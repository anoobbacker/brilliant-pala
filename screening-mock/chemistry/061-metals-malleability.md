## Question 
How many of the following metals are less malleable compared to gold?

i) Tin
ii) Lead
iii) Iron
iv) Nickel
v) Copper
vi) Zinc
vii)Aluminium


## Big idea first
When you hammer a metal into a thin sheet without it cracking, you’re testing its malleability. Gold is famously used to make gold leaf so thin that light passes through it — that’s a clue that gold lets its atomic layers slide past each other very easily.

So the question becomes: Are any of the listed metals better at this sliding than gold? If gold is the most malleable metal, then every other common metal must be less malleable.

We’ll justify that from first principles and then answer the count.

## Building from first principles

### 1) What is malleability, physically?
- Imagine atoms in a metal as tightly packed spheres arranged in layers, with a “sea” of shared electrons gluing them together.
- When you hammer the metal, you push layers of atoms to slide over each other.
- If layers can slide easily without the structure breaking, the metal is malleable.

A basic measure behind the scenes is whether the metal can undergo permanent shape change (plastic deformation) under compression without cracking. Stress is just force spread over area:

```math
\text{stress} = \frac{\text{force}}{\text{area}} \quad \text{(units: N/m}^2\text{)}
```

A malleable metal withstands lots of compressive deformation before it fractures.

### 2) Why can some metals slide more easily than others?
Two big reasons:
- Metallic bonds are non-directional (like glue that doesn’t care which way you slide), so sliding is possible at all.
- Crystal geometry: atoms are arranged in repeating 3D patterns (crystal structures). Sliding happens along certain “slip planes” and “slip directions.” More and better slip paths = easier sliding = higher malleability.

The common structures:
- FCC (face-centered cubic): many easy slip systems → very malleable.
- BCC (body-centered cubic): many possible slip directions but no close-packed planes → harder to start sliding at room temperature.
- HCP (hexagonal close packed): very few slip systems at room temperature → often brittle or only mildly malleable.

A neat geometric reason for FCC’s ease: its close-packed planes are the {111} planes, and along each such plane there are 3 close-packed directions. There are 4 such planes in a cube. So total slip systems ≈ 4 × 3 = 12 — that’s a lot of ways to slide.

### 3) Why is gold special?
- Gold is FCC, so it already has many easy slip systems.
- Its metallic bonds (with heavy atoms and lots of electrons) allow layers to slide with especially low resistance. In fact, gold can be beaten into sheets thinner than a micron. Empirically, gold is the most malleable metal known.
- That single fact means: compared to gold, every other common metal is less malleable.

## Classifying the given metals
We compare their room-temperature crystal structures and typical behavior under hammering/rolling:

- Gold (reference): FCC; the most malleable metal.
- i) Tin (white β-Sn): tetragonal structure; soft but not extremely malleable; less than gold.
- ii) Lead: FCC; quite malleable and soft, but still less than gold.
- iii) Iron (α-Fe): BCC at room temperature; less malleable unless heated; less than gold.
- iv) Nickel: FCC; malleable but stronger/harder than copper; less than gold.
- v) Copper: FCC; very malleable (copper sheets, cookware), but less than gold.
- vi) Zinc: HCP; relatively brittle at room temp, more malleable when warm; less than gold.
- vii) Aluminium: FCC; very malleable (aluminium foil), but still less than gold.

Key pattern: Even the very malleable FCC metals (Cu, Al, Ni, Pb) don’t surpass gold; HCP (Zn) and BCC at room temp (Fe) are certainly less malleable.

## Conclusion
- Gold is the most malleable metal.
- Therefore, every listed metal is less malleable than gold.

Answer: 7

## Quick logical proof snapshot
- Premise A: Gold is the most malleable metal (supported by both crystal slip geometry and overwhelming experimental evidence: gold leaf).
- Premise B: The list contains metals other than gold.
- Therefore, each listed metal has malleability ≤ gold. Since none equals gold’s malleability, all are strictly less.

Count = 7.

## Conceptual follow-up questions
1. Why does iron become much more malleable when heated (hint: austenite is FCC above about 912°C)?
2. If a pure metal is very malleable, how would adding a small amount of another element (forming an alloy) typically affect its malleability? Why?  
3. Compare malleability and ductility. Can a metal be highly ductile but not very malleable, or vice versa? Explain with examples.
4. Why is zinc brittle at room temperature but can be rolled into sheets when warmed to 100–150°C?

## Application questions
- Manufacturing: Why is aluminium chosen for household foil instead of copper or gold, given that gold is more malleable?
- Coinage: Why are coins often copper–nickel alloys rather than pure copper or pure nickel, considering malleability, strength, and wear?
- Engineering forming: In deep drawing (making cans), why are FCC metals preferred? How does the number of slip systems influence the success of forming operations?
- Heritage tech: How could artisans make gold leaf so thin without modern machines? What material properties made this feasible?

## Common misconceptions and reasoning traps
- “Soft = malleable = ductile.”  
  Correction: Softness is resistance to scratching/indentation; malleability is deformation under compression; ductility is deformation under tension. Related but not identical.
- “BCC has many slip systems, so it’s always more malleable.”  
  Correction: At room temperature, BCC lacks close-packed planes; activating slip needs higher stress/temperature → often less malleable than FCC at room temp.
- “All FCC metals are equally malleable.”  
  Correction: Purity, bonding strength, and stacking-fault energy also matter; FCC just sets a favorable stage.
- “Tin foil” in kitchens is tin.  
  Correction: Modern “tin foil” is aluminium; true tin foil was used historically and behaved differently.

## Extension challenges
- Geometry of slip: Sketch a cube and mark the {111} planes. Count the <110> directions within them to reconstruct the “12 slip systems” result for FCC.
- Hot vs cold working: Design a simple experiment to compare how much a zinc strip can be rolled at room temperature versus at 120°C without cracking. Predict, test, and explain.
- Alloying effect: Explain why adding a tiny amount of carbon to iron (forming steel) changes its formability and strength so dramatically.
- Energy landscape: Use the “deck of cards” model to visualize dislocations and why obstacles (impurities, grain boundaries) increase the stress needed for slip.

## Reflective insight
At its core, malleability is about how easily layers of atoms can rearrange while the metallic “glue” still holds. FCC metals provide many smooth sliding lanes; heavy, well-bonded, non-directional electron seas make sliding gentle rather than destructive. Gold sits at the extreme end of this spectrum. Once you see malleability as “the geometry and ease of atomic-layer sliding,” you can predict formability from structure, temperature, and purity — even for metals you’ve never handled before.
