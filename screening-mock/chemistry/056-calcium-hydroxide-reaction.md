# Answer
## Quick visual reasoning
- Picture Ca(OH)2 as a calcium “handle” holding two OH “hooks.” SO2 is an acidic, stingy gas.
- When they meet, the sulfur-oxygen piece locks onto calcium to make the chalky solid named in the question: CaSO3.
- After forming that solid, what bits are left from the starting pieces? The two H from the OH hooks and one O left over naturally snap together as a water droplet.
- So A is water.

Correct option: 4. H2O

## Create twists
- Common trap: Picking O2 or H2 just because they’re gases. But nothing here splits off pure oxygen, and hydrogen gas usually pops out when a metal reacts with acid, not when a base (Ca(OH)2) meets an acidic gas.
- Another trap: Thinking SO3 appears. But the sulfur is already seated in CaSO3; there’s no extra sulfur-oxygen cloud floating off.

Use the same idea elsewhere:
- Bubbling CO2 through limewater: the carbon piece grabs calcium to make a solid (CaCO3), and the leftover H and O from the hydroxide become water.
- In chimney scrubbers, spraying lime (Ca(OH)2) at acidic SO2 locks it into a solid salt and leaves water behind—exactly this logic in real engineering.

## Think like a scientist: What really happens when SO₂ meets Ca(OH)₂?

Imagine SO₂ as an “acidic smoke” (like the sharp smell near burning sulfur) and Ca(OH)₂ (slaked lime, in limewater) as a “cleaning base.” In everyday life, acids and bases neutralize each other. The deep question is: when this neutralization happens, what new particles form and why?

We’re given:
```math
\mathrm{Ca(OH)_2} + \mathrm{SO_2} \rightarrow \mathrm{CaSO_3} + \mathrm{A}
```
We must find A from the options: O₂, H₂, SO₃, or H₂O.

Let’s build this from first principles.

## Step-by-step reasoning from first principles

### 1) Identify the roles (chemistry as character roles)
- Ca(OH)₂ is a base. In water, it splits (dissociates) into ions:

```math
  \mathrm{Ca(OH)_2 \rightarrow Ca^{2+} + 2\,OH^-}
  ```
- SO₂ is an acidic oxide (acid anhydride). When SO₂ meets water, it forms an acid called sulfurous acid:

```math
  \mathrm{SO_2 + H_2O \rightleftharpoons H_2SO_3}
  ```

Why does this happen? Because SO₂ pulls in water to complete an “acid-like” structure that can donate H⁺. This is common for non-metal oxides like CO₂, SO₂, NO₂.

### 2) What do acids and bases do when they meet?
A base’s OH⁻ ions “seek” H⁺ from acids. When H⁺ and OH⁻ meet, they form neutral water:
```math
\mathrm{H^+ + OH^- \rightarrow H_2O}
```
So, if sulfurous acid H₂SO₃ meets OH⁻ from Ca(OH)₂, one product must be water.

### 3) Track all pieces to see what’s left
Start with these two steps:
- Hydration (making the acid):

```math
  \mathrm{SO_2 + H_2O \rightleftharpoons H_2SO_3}
  ```
- Neutralization (acid + base → salt + water):

```math
  \mathrm{H_2SO_3 + Ca(OH)_2 \rightarrow CaSO_3 + 2H_2O}
  ```

Now add them and cancel species that appear on both sides. H₂SO₃ is an intermediate, so it cancels. One H₂O on the left cancels with one of the two H₂O on the right. The net reaction becomes:
```math
\mathrm{Ca(OH)_2 + SO_2 \rightarrow CaSO_3 + H_2O}
```
So A must be water, H₂O.

### 4) Direct ionic view (no intermediates)
Alternatively, think without H₂SO₃:
- SO₂ behaves as an acid anhydride, and OH⁻ neutralizes it directly:

```math
  \mathrm{SO_2 + 2\,OH^- \rightarrow SO_3^{2-} + H_2O}
  ```
- The calcium ion pairs with sulfite to form the salt:

```math
  \mathrm{Ca^{2+} + SO_3^{2-} \rightarrow CaSO_3(s)}
  ```
Combine them:
```math
\mathrm{Ca(OH)_2 + SO_2 \rightarrow CaSO_3 + H_2O}
```

### 5) Sanity check by atom counting and charge balance
- Left side: Ca(OH)₂ (Ca₁ O₂ H₂), SO₂ (S₁ O₂). Total O = 4, H = 2.
- Right side: CaSO₃ (Ca₁ S₁ O₃), H₂O (H₂ O₁). Total O = 4, H = 2.
- No net charge both sides. Balanced perfectly.

### 6) Use redox logic to eliminate wrong options
- O₂ (option 1) or H₂ (option 2) would require oxidation/reduction (electron transfer). But sulfur stays at oxidation state +4 in both SO₂ and SO₃²⁻ (in CaSO₃), so this is not a redox reaction. So no O₂ or H₂ forms here.
- SO₃ (option 3) would require oxidizing SO₂ further (S from +4 to +6). No oxidizing agent is present. So not SO₃.
- Water (H₂O) naturally appears in neutralization, matching both the mechanism and the balance.

Conclusion: A = H₂O.

Answer: 4) H₂O

## Multiple complementary perspectives

- Intuitive (kitchen chemistry): Acidic fumes + base → neutralization → salt + water. Here, “salt” is calcium sulfite (CaSO₃), and the “neutral bits” (H⁺ from the acid side and OH⁻ from the base) form water.
- Analytical (ionic): SO₂ + 2OH⁻ → SO₃²⁻ + H₂O; then Ca²⁺ + SO₃²⁻ → CaSO₃.
- Redox check: No change in oxidation states, so exclude gas evolutions like H₂/O₂ and exclude SO₃ formation.

## Real-world link: Why engineers care
Power plants remove harmful SO₂ from flue gases by spraying them with lime or limestone slurries (Ca(OH)₂ or CaCO₃). This “scrubbing” forms calcium sulfite (CaSO₃) and water. With oxygen present, the sulfite can further oxidize to calcium sulfate (CaSO₄), a solid called gypsum—used in drywall.

## Final answer
A = H₂O (Option 4)

## 1) Conceptual follow-up questions
- If SO₂ is bubbled into excess limewater with some oxygen present, what solid might you eventually form? Explain the role of oxygen.
- Suppose you used NaOH solution instead of Ca(OH)₂. Write the net ionic equation and the full molecular equation.
- If an acid anhydride is a non-metal oxide that forms an acid with water, what kind of oxide is CaO, and what does it form with water?
- When excess SO₂ is passed through a limited amount of Ca(OH)₂, could an acid salt like Ca(HSO₃)₂ form? Write a plausible equation.

---

## 2) Applications to modern problems
- Flue-gas desulfurization: Compare using Ca(OH)₂ vs CaCO₃ for SO₂ removal. Which byproducts form, and how do cost and solubility affect design choices?
- Indoor air quality: How might building materials or paints be engineered to neutralize acidic gases like SO₂ without degrading?
- Environmental chemistry: Explain how SO₂ in the atmosphere leads to acid rain. Contrast H₂SO₃ vs H₂SO₄ formation pathways.

---

## 3) Common misconceptions and how to avoid them
- “SO₂ always makes SO₃.” Not true. Oxidation to SO₃ needs an oxidizing pathway (e.g., oxygen + catalyst). Here, no oxidizer is present.
- “Gas + base gives hydrogen gas.” Hydrogen gas typically forms when acids react with reactive metals, not when acidic oxides react with bases.
- “Two OH⁻ means two waters.” Only if there are two available H⁺. Here, the net stoichiometry with SO₂ gives exactly one H₂O. Always balance atoms and charges.
- Confusing sulfite (SO₃²⁻) with sulfate (SO₄²⁻). Check oxidation state: S is +4 in sulfite, +6 in sulfate.

---

## 4) Extension challenges
- Derive, step by step, the balanced equation for oxidation of CaSO₃ to CaSO₄ in the presence of O₂ and water. Then verify atom and charge balance.
- If 1.00 mol of SO₂ reacts completely with Ca(OH)₂, how many moles of water form? Now design a lab test (mass change, conductivity, or pH) to confirm the stoichiometry experimentally.
- Model the pH change when SO₂ is bubbled into water vs into limewater. Explain using acid-base equilibria and buffering ideas.

---

## 5) Reflective insight: the essence
This reaction is a textbook example of acid-base neutralization disguised as oxide chemistry. The identity of “A” falls out naturally once you see:
- SO₂ behaves as an acidic oxide (forms or acts like H₂SO₃),
- Ca(OH)₂ releases OH⁻,
- H⁺ and OH⁻ inevitably combine to make the most stable, neutral molecule possible: water.

When in doubt, don’t memorize—trace the particles:
Who donates H⁺? Who donates OH⁻? What stable pair can they form? Then count atoms and charges. This logic will guide you through many unfamiliar reactions with confidence.
