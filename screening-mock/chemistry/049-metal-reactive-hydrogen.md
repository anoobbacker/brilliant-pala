# Answer
Decide which metal (Hg, Cu, Ag, Sn) is more reactive than hydrogen — meaning it can push hydrogen out of an acid to make hydrogen gas.

## Quick visual reasoning
- Picture dropping each metal into a beaker of dilute acid.
- The metal that can push hydrogen out of the liquid will make tiny bubbles rise right away.
- What you’d see:
  - Silver: stays shiny and calm; no fizz.
  - Copper: calm; that’s why copper pipes don’t bubble away in water or mild acids.
  - Mercury: a heavy silvery liquid bead; also calm in ordinary acids.
  - Tin: steady fizzing as gas bubbles form — it pushes hydrogen out.

So, the one more reactive than hydrogen here is Tin (Sn).

## Create twists
- Visual traps to avoid:
  - “Shiny means reactive.” Not true. Silver is very shiny yet sits quietly in acid.
  - “Liquid metal must be wild.” Mercury looks dramatic but doesn’t fizz in ordinary acids.
  - “Used in cans means super-stable.” Tin protects steel, but with acidic foods it can slowly give off gas — showing it can still push out hydrogen.

- Same idea, different-looking problem:
  - “Which metal will release gas with acid?” Think “who makes bubbles?” That’s the one above hydrogen in pushiness.
  - Metal displacement in solutions: imagine two kids on a seesaw. The stronger jumper (more reactive metal) kicks the other off the seat and takes their place. If no swap happens, the newcomer is weaker.

- Where this shows up in life:
  - Tin-plated food cans: slightly acidic food can nibble at tin and release a little gas — quiet evidence that tin can oust hydrogen.
  - Copper plumbing: no fizzing or rapid eating away in ordinary water or mild acids — copper sits below hydrogen in pushiness.
  - Silver jewelry: resists mild acids; tarnishes mainly with sulfur in air, not by kicking out hydrogen.

Final choice: Tin (Sn).

## Build-up from everyday observation
- If you drop some metals (like zinc or magnesium) in dilute hydrochloric acid, you see bubbles. Those bubbles are hydrogen gas.
- Other metals (like copper or silver) just sit there. No bubbles.
- So “more reactive than hydrogen” simply means: the metal can give electrons to hydrogen ions in the acid, turning them into hydrogen gas.

## What does “displace hydrogen” really mean?
Acids in water contain hydrogen ions, H+ (think of HCl → H+ + Cl−). For hydrogen gas to appear from an acid, two things must happen:
1. The metal atom gives away electrons (that’s what “reactive metals” are good at).
2. Hydrogen ions take those electrons and pair up as H2 gas.

Write that cleanly as two steps (half-reactions), then add them:
- Metal loses electrons (oxidation):
```math
\text{M(s)} \rightarrow \text{M}^{n+}(\text{aq}) + n e^-
```
- Hydrogen ions gain electrons (reduction):
```math
2 \text{H}^+(\text{aq}) + 2 e^- \rightarrow \text{H}_2(\text{g})
```
If we match electron counts (most common case with n=2), the overall reaction is:
```math
\text{M(s)} + 2 \text{H}^+(\text{aq}) \rightarrow \text{M}^{2+}(\text{aq}) + \text{H}_2(\text{g})
```
So the test is simple:
- If the metal can “afford” to give electrons more easily than hydrogen does, this reaction goes forward and you see bubbles (more reactive than hydrogen).
- If it can’t, no bubbles (less reactive than hydrogen).

## How can we compare “who gives electrons more easily”?
Two complementary approaches:

### 1) Experimental intuition (what you’d see in school)
- Put strips of the four metals in dilute HCl or dilute H2SO4.
  - Tin (Sn): produces hydrogen gas (fizzing) → more reactive than H.
  - Copper (Cu): no hydrogen gas → less reactive than H.
  - Silver (Ag): no hydrogen gas → less reactive than H.
  - Mercury (Hg): no hydrogen gas with non-oxidizing acids → less reactive than H.

This already answers the question: Tin is the one above hydrogen in reactivity here.

### 2) Energy/electron-push logic (first-principles cause)
Scientists rank how strongly substances “pull” or “push” electrons using a reference called the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). By definition:
```math
E^\circ(\text{H}^+/\text{H}_2) = 0 \text{ V}
```
- If a metal’s M^2+/M value is negative, it means the metal prefers to exist as M(s) and will readily give electrons away; it can donate electrons to H+ → hydrogen gas forms.
- If it’s positive, its ions “like” electrons more than H+ does; the metal won’t give electrons to H+ → no hydrogen gas.

Typical values (room temperature, standard conditions):
- Sn^2+/Sn: about −0.14 V → can reduce H+ to H2 (above hydrogen).
- Cu^2+/Cu: +0.34 V → cannot reduce H+ (below hydrogen).
- Ag^+/Ag: +0.80 V → cannot reduce H+ (below hydrogen).
- Hg^2+/Hg (or Hg2^2+/Hg): around +0.79–0.85 V → cannot reduce H+ (below hydrogen).

This matches the experiment: only Sn is more reactive than hydrogen.

## Conclusion
- Correct option: 4. Tin (Sn)

## Quick reality checks and nuances
- Copper and silver do dissolve in strong oxidizing acids (like concentrated nitric acid), but they do not produce hydrogen gas; instead, the acid supplies a stronger oxidizer (like nitrate), giving brown NO2 fumes. That’s a different mechanism from “displacing hydrogen.”
- Mercury is less reactive than hydrogen with non-oxidizing acids at room conditions.

## Conceptual follow-up questions
1. If a metal produces hydrogen gas with dilute HCl, what does that tell you about its position relative to hydrogen in the reactivity ranking?
2. Why does copper react with concentrated nitric acid but not with dilute hydrochloric acid? What is playing the role of the “electron taker” in each case?
3. If the hydrogen reference potential is set to 0 V, what does a negative metal potential tell you about the direction of electron flow?
4. Suppose you increase the acid concentration (more H+). How could that affect the tendency for a borderline metal to produce hydrogen? Hint: consider that more H+ makes the reduction of H+ easier.

## Application questions (link to real life)
- Corrosion protection: Why do we coat iron with zinc (galvanization) and not with copper? Tie your answer to their positions relative to hydrogen and their electron-giving tendencies.
- Battery design: A zinc–carbon battery uses zinc as the anode (electron giver). Would tin be a possible anode compared to copper or silver? Explain using their ability to donate electrons relative to hydrogen.
- Industrial pickling of steel: Why does hydrogen gas sometimes evolve during cleaning steel with acid, and what safety measures are needed?

## Common misconceptions and reasoning traps
- “Hydrogen is a metal in the series.” It’s not; it’s a nonmetal reference point that helps compare electron donation tendencies.
- “If a metal doesn’t react with HCl, it won’t react with any acid.” False. Some acids are oxidizing (e.g., nitric acid) and dissolve even less reactive metals without producing H2.
- “Density or hardness decides reactivity.” No. Reactivity is about electron transfer energetics, not heaviness or strength.
- “If a metal forms pretty tarnish slowly, it must be less reactive than hydrogen.” Tarnish involves oxygen/sulfur chemistry, not necessarily hydrogen displacement.

## Extension challenges
- Design a simple lab test: Given unknown metal strips A, B, C, decide which are above hydrogen using only dilute HCl and your senses. How would you confirm borderline cases safely?
- Use the logic of half-reactions to predict whether iron (Fe) or lead (Pb) should produce hydrogen with dilute acid. Then check with reputable data.
- Build a thought-experiment cell: Sn(s) | Sn^2+(aq) || H+(aq) | H2(g) | Pt(s). Predict the cell voltage using the sign of potentials. Which direction will electrons flow?

## Reflective insight
At its core, “reactivity relative to hydrogen” is a story about where electrons want to go to lower the system’s energy. Metals above hydrogen are eager to let go of electrons; hydrogen ions are ready to take them. When that electron handoff lowers energy, hydrogen gas appears. The reactivity series is not a list to memorize—it’s a map of electron flow preferences. Once you think in terms of who gives and who takes electrons, unfamiliar reactions become predictable.
