# Question
How many different oxides are formed when anhydrous ferrous sulphate is heated in a dry boiling tube over a flame?

# Answer
Three oxides: a brown solid iron oxide, plus two sulfur oxides (the sharp choking one and the mist-forming one).

## Quick visual reasoning
- Imagine the salt as “iron stuck to a sulfur-oxygen bundle.”
- Heat snaps it apart. The heavy iron prefers to stay and hug oxygen, settling as a rusty-brown powder (iron oxide).
- The sulfur side flies off as fumes. You see two behaviors:
  - A sharp, choking gas like a burning match.
  - A harsher vapor that instantly makes a white mist with moist air.
- So you’ve got one solid oxide (iron) and two gaseous oxides (sulfur): total three.

Names: iron(III) oxide, sulfur dioxide, sulfur trioxide.

## Create twists
- Typical visual traps:
  - Counting steam: If crystals had water or the tube was damp, steam would appear; water is also an oxide. The question avoids this by saying anhydrous and dry.
  - Assuming only one sulfur gas: Look for two clues—choking smell versus instant mist with moisture—showing two different sulfur oxides.

- Use the same idea elsewhere:
  - Heating a metal carbonate: the metal stays as a dull metal oxide; the non‑metal part escapes as one gas that snuffs flames.
  - Roasting sulfide/sulfate ores in smelters: metals end as oxides; sulfur leaves as sulfur oxides.

- In nature/engineering:
  - The brown residue is the same stuff as rust—iron grabbing oxygen.
  - Industry turns the sharp sulfur gas into the mist-forming one to make acid, matching the two gases seen here.

## Build-up from first principles

### 1) Everyday intuition: what heat does to compounds
- When you heat complex substances, they often “fall apart” into simpler, more stable pieces.  
  - Example: Baking causes dough to release gases and change structure; heating copper carbonate gives copper oxide and carbon dioxide.
- For a sulfate (which is rich in oxygen), a natural way to “simplify” under heat is to form:
  - A metal oxide (metal + oxygen)
  - Nonmetal oxides (sulfur + oxygen), which we already know exist as SO2 and SO3 in air pollution and acid rain chemistry.

### 2) What are we heating?
- Anhydrous ferrous sulfate is FeSO4 (iron in the +2 state, no water attached).
- A dry boiling tube is used so that water doesn’t interfere and make extra products like sulfuric acid fumes.

### 3) Predicting the kinds of products logically
- Ask: Where can the oxygen go?
  - Iron likes to form a stable oxide under heating, commonly Fe2O3 (iron(III) oxide).
  - Sulfur tends to appear as SO2 and/or SO3 when oxygen is available.
- So, a reasonable guess is: FeSO4 → an iron oxide + sulfur oxides.

### 4) Determine exactly which oxides and in what ratio (by atom counting)
Assume on strong heating:
```math
2\,\text{FeSO}_4 \xrightarrow{\Delta} \text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3 + a\,\text{SO}_2 + b\,\text{SO}_3
```
- Balance Fe: Left has 2 Fe → choose Fe2O3 on right (already balanced for Fe).
- Balance S: Left has 2 S → a + b = 2
- Balance O: Left has 2×4 = 8 O → right has 3 (in Fe2O3) + 2a + 3b  
  So: 3 + 2a + 3b = 8 → 2a + 3b = 5

Solve the two equations:
- a + b = 2
- 2a + 3b = 5
Subtract twice the first from the second: (2a + 3b) − 2(a + b) = 5 − 4 → b = 1 → then a = 1.

So the reaction is:
```math
2\,\text{FeSO}_4 \xrightarrow{\Delta} \text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3 + \text{SO}_2 + \text{SO}_3
```

This shows three different oxides are produced:
- Solid: Fe2O3 (iron(III) oxide)
- Gases: SO2 (sulfur dioxide), SO3 (sulfur trioxide)

### 5) Why this makes chemical sense (cause-effect, oxidation states)
- In FeSO4, Fe is +2 and S in sulfate is +6.
- In Fe2O3, Fe is +3 (iron got oxidized).
- In SO2, S is +4 (sulfur got reduced), and in SO3, S is +6 (unchanged).
- So, part of the sulfate reduces to SO2, while the rest stays as SO3—this internal redox “balances” the electron bookkeeping without needing outside reagents.

### 6) Experimental signs you can observe
- Color: FeSO4 (greenish) → Fe2O3 (brown solid).
- Smell: a choking, pungent gas (SO2).
- Tests:
  - SO2 turns acidified potassium dichromate from orange to green or decolorizes acidified KMnO4.
  - SO3 forms dense white fumes with moist air (it makes H2SO4 upon contact with water).
- The “dry boiling tube” condition helps you focus on these oxides, avoiding extra reactions with water.

## Final conclusion
- Number of different oxides formed on heating anhydrous FeSO4 in a dry tube: 3 (Fe2O3, SO2, SO3).

## Conceptual follow-up questions
1. If you heated hydrated ferrous sulfate crystals (FeSO4·7H2O) instead, what additional steps or observations would appear before decomposition?
2. Why doesn’t FeO appear as the final iron oxide under these conditions, even though Fe is initially +2?
3. If the atmosphere had very little oxygen available, how might the product distribution of SO2 vs SO3 change?
4. Could Fe3O4 ever form in such a decomposition? Under what different conditions might that happen?

## Application questions
- Industrial: How is SO2 from roasting sulfide ores captured and converted to H2SO4 in the Contact process, and what role does SO3 play?
- Environmental: Why are SO2 and SO3 major concerns in air pollution and acid rain? How do scrubbers remove them from flue gases?
- Sensors: How could you design a simple lab sensor to distinguish SO2 from SO3 using their differing reactions with water and oxidizing agents?

## Common misconceptions and reasoning traps
- “Only metals form oxides.”  
  Correction: Nonmetals form oxides too (e.g., CO2, SO2, SO3). We count all oxides formed.
- “Fe stays +2 because we started with FeSO4.”  
  Correction: Heating can change oxidation states; Fe(II) is oxidized to Fe(III) here.
- “SO2 and SO3 can’t both form at once.”  
  Correction: They can, and do, because the sulfate part can both reduce (to SO2) and remain at +6 (SO3), balancing electrons internally.

## Extension challenges
- Balance this thermal decomposition by starting with 1 mole of FeSO4 and expressing products as fractions, then scale to integers. Explain why integer coefficients matter in chemical equations.
- Propose an experiment to quantitatively measure the relative amounts of SO2 and SO3 produced (hint: selective absorption—SO3 in dry vs moist conditions).
- Use redox half-equations to track electron flow from Fe(II) to Fe(III) and from S(+6) to S(+4), and show that total electrons are conserved.

## Reflective insight
At its core, thermal decomposition of an oxygen-rich salt is a “reorganization” toward stable building blocks: metals prefer solid oxides; nonmetals prefer gaseous oxides. Atom counting and oxidation states together tell you not just what could form, but in what proportions—letting you derive the reaction from first principles rather than memorizing it.
