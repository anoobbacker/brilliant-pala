   2) Sodium (Na)  
   3) Oxygen (O)  
   4) Magnesium (Mg)

# Answer

## Quick visual reasoning
- Picture each row of the periodic table as a bench that fills from left to right. The far right column is a “full bench” (stable).
- Move left from that full bench:
  - One step left: almost full, missing one seat (that’s where Fluorine sits) → not two in the outer shell.
  - Two steps left: missing two seats (Oxygen) → not two in the outer shell.
- Now look at the far left edge: a new bench starts with just one person (Sodium) → one outer electron.
- The seat right next to it has two people (Magnesium) → two outer electrons.

Answer: Magnesium (Mg).

## Create twists
- Visual trap: Oxygen “needs two” to fill, but that means it already has many in the shell, not two. Don’t confuse “needs two” with “has two.”
- Visual trap: Fluorine is almost full (one empty seat), so it’s not the “two-electron” one.
- Same idea, different problem: “Which element would easily lose two electrons to bond?” Look for the second seat from the left in a row → Magnesium again.
- In the real world: Magnesium burns with a bright white light because those two outer electrons are easy to give away, forming very stable products. This matches the “second seat has two” picture.

## Which element has two electrons in the outermost shell?

### Start with a real-world image
Think of atoms like buildings with floors (shells). The top floor is where the action happens — that’s where atoms “shake hands” with other atoms. The number of people on the top floor is what chemists call valence electrons (outermost shell electrons). This number largely decides how an atom reacts.

## Build from fundamentals

### How do electrons fill shells?
- First shell (K): holds up to 2 electrons
- Second shell (L): holds up to 8 electrons
- Third shell (M): for the first 20 elements, we usually fill up to 8 before moving on

So for the first 20 elements, we often see patterns like 2, 8, 8, ...

### Fast method using atomic numbers
Let’s write the electron configurations for each:

- Fluorine (F), Z = 9 → 2, 7 → 7 in outer shell
- Sodium (Na), Z = 11 → 2, 8, 1 → 1 in outer shell
- Oxygen (O), Z = 8 → 2, 6 → 6 in outer shell
- Magnesium (Mg), Z = 12 → 2, 8, 2 → 2 in outer shell

Answer: Magnesium (Mg)

## Another lens: Periodic table logic
- Elements in the same column (group) have the same number of outer electrons.
- Group 2 (alkaline earth metals) → 2 valence electrons.
- Magnesium is in Group 2 → 2 in the outermost shell.

Text-visual:
- Mg: [K] 2 | [L] 8 | [M] 2 → outermost = 2

## Conceptual Follow-ups
- What if Mg becomes Mg²⁺? It loses its two outer electrons, leaving a full (stable) shell underneath.
- Why are Group 2 metals less reactive than Group 1? They must lose two electrons instead of one — that’s harder, so slower.

## Real-world connection
- Magnesium forms Mg²⁺ easily and is used in alloys (like in aircraft) and fireworks (bright white light). Its “2 valence electrons” is why it commonly forms compounds like MgO and MgCl₂.

## Misconception Clinic
- Many students think “third period → 3 valence electrons.” Actually, period number = number of shells, not valence electrons.
- A common mistake is assuming “more total electrons means more in the outer shell.” Outer shell count depends on shell filling, not just total.
- “All noble gases have 8 valence electrons.” Helium is the exception with 2 (full first shell).

## Extension Challenge
- Predict for Calcium (Ca, Z = 20): configuration 2, 8, 8, 2 → also 2 valence electrons (Group 2).
- Compare chlorine (Cl, Z = 17) → 2, 8, 7 → 7 valence electrons → tends to gain 1 electron to become Cl⁻.

## Practice Questions
1) Which has 1 valence electron?  
   a) Li b) Be c) O d) Ne  
2) Write the electron configuration for Aluminium (Z = 13). How many valence electrons?
3) Which pair are in the same group and why: Na and Mg, Mg and Ca, O and N?

Answers:
1) a) Li (2, 1)  
2) Al: 2, 8, 3 → 3 valence electrons  
3) Mg and Ca (both Group 2; 2 valence electrons)
