# Answer
## Quick visual reasoning
- Air: Open a window—what comes in is a blend of many gases that still look invisible. Blending without a fixed recipe = mixture; looks clear = colourless.
- Chlorine: In a jar, it has a faint green-yellow tint you can actually see. One kind of basic substance = element; tint = greenish yellow.
- Rust: On old iron, the flaky brown layer isn’t metallic anymore—new stuff formed after reacting, with a fixed look and feel = compound; colour = brown.

Matches:
- 1) Air → mixture (c) and colourless (a)
- 2) Chlorine → element (a) and greenish yellow (c)
- 3) Rust → compound (b) and brown (b)

Correct option: B

## Create twists
- Visual traps to avoid:
  - “All gases are colourless” → chlorine isn’t; in sunlight, its green-yellow tint shows in a jar.
  - “Air is a compound” → its proportions change place to place; mixtures vary, compounds don’t.
  - “Rust is just iron mixed with oxygen” → it’s a new substance with different look and no metallic shine—so a compound.

- Same idea, different look:
  - Salt water: variable saltiness → mixture, colourless.
  - Copper metal: one basic kind → element, reddish.
  - Copper sulfate crystals: new fixed substance → compound, blue.

- Nature/engineering check:
  - Air is split into oxygen and nitrogen in industry—shows it’s a mixture.
  - Chlorine’s greenish gas used for disinfection.
  - Brown rust coats bridges and ships—clear sign of a new compound.
  
## Match the substance, its type, and its colour — by thinking from first principles

### Start with a simple question
Look around: 
- What colour is the air in your room? 
- If you’ve seen a swimming pool disinfected with chlorine, what colour gas do you imagine? 
- And what colour is the flaky stuff on old iron gates?

These everyday clues already tell you a lot.

## Build from fundamentals

### How do we classify substances?
- Element: one kind of atom only. Like pure LEGO bricks of a single colour.
- Compound: two or more elements chemically bonded in fixed ratios. Like two colours fused into a new piece — you can’t separate without “breaking bonds.”
- Mixture: different substances just mingled, not bonded. Like a bowl of mixed candies — you can separate by picking.

### Why do substances have colours?
- A substance looks coloured if it absorbs some wavelengths of visible light and reflects/transmits others.
  - If it absorbs very little across the visible range, we see it as colourless.
  - If it absorbs certain colours more strongly, we see the leftover mix (e.g., removing blue makes it look yellow-green).

## Reason it out for each substance

1) Air
- What is it? Mostly nitrogen and oxygen, plus small amounts of argon, CO2, water vapour, etc.
- Type: A mixture (different gases not chemically bonded, proportions can vary).
- Colour: Colourless in small amounts (doesn’t strongly absorb visible light).
- Match: Mixture (c); Colourless (a)

2) Chlorine
- What is it? The element chlorine as Cl2 molecules (still an element because all atoms are chlorine).
- Type: Element.
- Colour: Greenish-yellow gas (it absorbs violet-blue light strongly).
- Match: Element (a); Greenish yellow (c)

3) Rust
- What is it? Hydrated iron(III) oxide (like Fe2O3·xH2O).
- Type: Compound (iron and oxygen chemically bonded in fixed ratios).
- Colour: Brown/reddish-brown solid.
- Match: Compound (b); Brown (b)

## Final matching

- 1) Air → Type: c (Mixture), Colour: a (Colourless)
- 2) Chlorine → Type: a (Element), Colour: c (Greenish yellow)
- 3) Rust → Type: b (Compound), Colour: b (Brown)

From the given choices, this corresponds to Option B (the one that correctly pairs rust with brown and assigns Air = mixture, Chlorine = element).

Answer: B

> ### 🧠 Quick Exam Tips
> - Mixture = variable composition, no chemical bonds between components (Air).
> - Element = single type of atom (Chlorine gas is Cl2 but still an element).
> - Rust is a compound (iron + oxygen chemically combined) and is brown.
> - Chlorine’s classic exam colour: greenish-yellow. Air: colourless.

## Misconception Clinic
- Many students think “Cl2 is two atoms, so it must be a compound.” Actually, a compound means different elements bonded. Cl2 is two of the same element — still an element.
- A common mistake is calling air a compound because it’s “made of gases.” Mixture vs compound hinges on bonding and fixed ratios; air has neither.

## Quick Practice
1) Is water vapour in air part of a mixture or a compound? Explain in one line.
2) Oxygen gas, O2: element or compound? What colour?
3) Why isn’t rust just “iron dust”? What makes it a different substance?
