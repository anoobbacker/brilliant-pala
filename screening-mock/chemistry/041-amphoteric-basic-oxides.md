# Answer

## Quick visual reasoning
- Picture four bins:
  - Chalky metal ashes that neutralize acids → basic oxides.
  - Borderline “chameleons” that dissolve in both acids and bases → amphoteric oxides.
  - Sour, biting fumes that make acidic solutions → acidic oxides.
  - Quiet, non-reactive ones → neutral oxides.

- Sort each given compound by how it behaves:
  - CO, NO: quiet gases; don’t make solutions acidic or basic → neutral → not counted.
  - CO₂, NO₂: sour/biting fumes; make acidic solutions → acidic → not counted.
  - H₂O: balanced, neither neutralizes acids nor bases as an oxide → neutral → not counted.
  - Na₂O, CaO: chalky metal ashes; soak up acids → basic → count.
  - CuO: metal ash; reacts with acids to give salts → basic → count.
  - ZnO, Al₂O₃: “chameleons”; dissolve in both acid and base → amphoteric → count.

- Count the ones that are basic or amphoteric: Na₂O, CaO, CuO, ZnO, Al₂O₃ → 5.

Answer - 5

## Create twists
- Visual traps to avoid:
  - “Water is amphoteric” in acid–base talk, but as an oxide it’s neutral here.
  - “More oxygen means more basic.” For nonmetals (like C, N), more oxygen usually gives acidic fumes (CO₂, NO₂).
  - “All metal oxides are basic.” Borderline metals (small, charge-dense like Al, Zn) give amphoteric oxides.

- Same idea, different look:
  - Ask “Which solids dissolve in both acid and alkali?” → pick the chameleons (ZnO, Al₂O₃).
  - “Which oxide to neutralize an acid spill?” → pick chalky basic ashes (CaO, Na₂O, CuO).

- Seen in life/engineering:
  - Quicklime (CaO) “sweetens” acidic soil → basic.
  - Aluminum stays protected by Al₂O₃ film that can be eaten by both strong acids and bases → amphoteric.
  - CO₂ makes fizzy drinks sour → acidic, so not in our count.

## Start with a real-world hook

If you burn things in oxygen, you get “ashes” called oxides. Some of these oxides behave like bases (they make solutions slippery and alkaline), some behave like acids (they make sour, reactive solutions), some can do both (amphoteric), and some are neutral and don’t react much.

Question to think about: If the element is very metallic (like sodium or calcium), would its “ash” (oxide) act more like a base or an acid?

Answer: Metals strongly “donate” electrons, so their oxides tend to be ionic and basic. Nonmetals (like carbon and nitrogen) hold electrons tightly, so their oxides are covalent and acidic. Elements on the border (like aluminum and zinc) often give amphoteric oxides.

## The guiding rules (built from intuition)

- Strongly metallic element + oxygen → ionic oxide with O2− ions → tends to accept protons (behaves as a base). These oxides react with acids to make salts and water, and many form hydroxides in water.
- Strongly nonmetal element + oxygen → covalent oxide that reacts with water to make an acid → acidic oxide.
- Borderline metals (Al, Zn, Be, Sn, Pb, Cr(III)) → amphoteric oxides that react with both acids and bases.
- Some oxides don’t react much with acids or bases → neutral oxides (e.g., CO, NO, H2O).

Think: “metallic → basic,” “nonmetallic → acidic,” “in-between → amphoteric.”

## Classify each given oxide

We’ll check how each behaves with acids and bases (or in water).

1) CO (carbon monoxide)  
- Neutral oxide. Doesn’t form an acid or base with water, and is not noticeably reactive with acids/bases in this context.

2) NO (nitric oxide)  
- Neutral oxide. Similar reasoning to CO.

3) Na₂O (sodium oxide)  
- Strongly basic (Group 1 metal). Reacts with water to give a strong base:

```math
  \mathrm{Na_2O + H_2O \rightarrow 2\,NaOH}
  ```

4) CaO (calcium oxide, quicklime)  
- Basic (Group 2 metal). Reacts with water to make calcium hydroxide:

```math
  \mathrm{CaO + H_2O \rightarrow Ca(OH)_2}
  ```

5) H₂O (water)  
- Neutral oxide in this classification. (Yes, water can act as an acid or base in acid–base reactions, but as an oxide of hydrogen it’s categorized as neutral, not amphoteric oxide.)

6) ZnO (zinc oxide)  
- Amphoteric (borderline metal). Reacts with acids and bases:

```math
  \mathrm{ZnO + 2\,HCl \rightarrow ZnCl_2 + H_2O}
  ```

```math
  \mathrm{ZnO + 2\,NaOH \rightarrow Na_2ZnO_2 + H_2O}
  ```

7) CO₂ (carbon dioxide)  
- Acidic oxide (nonmetal). Forms carbonic acid in water:

```math
  \mathrm{CO_2 + H_2O \rightarrow H_2CO_3}
  ```

8) NO₂ (nitrogen dioxide)  
- Acidic oxide. Forms acids in water (nitric and nitrous acids), overall acidic behavior.

9) Al₂O₃ (aluminum oxide)  
- Amphoteric. Reacts with both acids and bases:

```math
  \mathrm{Al_2O_3 + 6\,HCl \rightarrow 2\,AlCl_3 + 3\,H_2O}
  ```

```math
  \mathrm{Al_2O_3 + 2\,NaOH \rightarrow 2\,NaAlO_2 + H_2O}
  ```

10) CuO (copper(II) oxide)  
- Basic oxide. Reacts with acids (e.g., HCl) to form salts, but not with bases:

```math
  \mathrm{CuO + 2\,HCl \rightarrow CuCl_2 + H_2O}
  ```

## Count them

- Amphoteric: ZnO, Al₂O₃ → 2
- Basic: Na₂O, CaO, CuO → 3

Total that are either amphoteric or basic = 2 + 3 = 5

## Conceptual follow-ups

- What if we move across Period 3 (Na → Mg → Al → Si → P → S → Cl)? Oxides go from basic (Na₂O, MgO) to amphoteric (Al₂O₃) to acidic (SiO₂, P₄O₁₀, SO₃, Cl₂O₇). This reflects decreasing metallic character.
- Higher oxidation states for nonmetals usually give more acidic oxides (e.g., SO₂ vs SO₃; NO vs NO₂).

## Real-world links

- Flue gas scrubbers remove acidic oxides like SO₂/CO₂ using basic materials like CaO/CaCO₃ (limestone).
- Cement uses CaO/Ca(OH)₂ basicity; choosing materials to neutralize acidic gases relies on oxide classification.

## Misconception clinic

- Many students think water (H₂O) is an amphoteric oxide because it’s amphiprotic in acid–base reactions. But in oxide classification, H₂O is considered a neutral oxide since it doesn’t react with acids/bases to form salts.
- A common mistake is assuming all transition metal oxides are amphoteric. Not true: CuO is basic; ZnO and Cr₂O₃ are amphoteric.
- Some think “CO is acidic because it’s a carbon oxide.” Actually CO is neutral; it doesn’t form an acid with water. CO₂ is the acidic one.

## Extension challenges

- Connect to electronegativity: as the central atom’s electronegativity increases (and ionic character decreases), oxides tend to be more acidic.
- In metallurgy, amphoteric behavior explains why certain fluxes (like Al₂O₃) can capture both acidic and basic impurities.

## Practice questions

1) Classify SO₂, SO₃, and MgO as acidic, basic, or amphoteric.  
2) Which oxide would best neutralize an acid spill: SiO₂, Al₂O₃, or CaO? Why?  
3) Predict the nature (acidic/basic/amphoteric) of BeO and SnO₂.  
4) True/False: NO is an acidic oxide because nitrogen is a nonmetal.  
5) Arrange Na₂O, Al₂O₃, P₄O₁₀ in order from most basic to most acidic.

Suggested answers (brief):
1) SO₂ and SO₃: acidic; MgO: basic.  
2) CaO (strongly basic).  
3) BeO and SnO₂: amphoteric.  
4) False (NO is neutral).  
5) Na₂O (basic) > Al₂O₃ (amphoteric) > P₄O₁₀ (acidic).

> ### Reflective essence
> Nature rarely jumps; it blends. Oxides smoothly shift from basic to acidic as metallic character fades—amphoteric oxides sit at the border, reminding us that categories are tools, while chemistry is a continuum.
