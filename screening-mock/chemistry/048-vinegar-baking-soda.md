# Answer
## Quick visual reasoning
- Vinegar on baking soda fizzes like a soda drink — that gas is the same one that makes bubbles in fizzy drinks.
- Bubble this gas through clear limewater: it suddenly turns cloudy, like diluted milk. That means tiny solid particles have formed and are floating around.
- What solid forms when this gas meets the calcium in limewater? Think chalk: a fine white, cloudy solid. Chalk is calcium carbonate.
- So the new milky solid is calcium carbonate.

Answer: 3. Calcium carbonate

## Create twists
- Visual trap 1: “Calcium hydroxide” is already in limewater. Since the limewater was clear before the gas, it can’t be the cause of new milkiness.
- Visual trap 2: “Calcium bicarbonate” usually stays dissolved; in fact, if you keep bubbling the gas for long, the milkiness can fade because the chalk dissolves into this form. So the first milkiness isn’t bicarbonate.
- Same idea, different look:
  - Blow into limewater with a straw: it turns milky — breath contains the same fizz gas.
  - Drop acid on a seashell or limestone: it fizzes; the gas bubbled into limewater turns it milky — again, chalk forms.
- In nature/engineering:
  - Caves: water with the fizz gas dissolves rock; later the gas escapes and chalky rock (calcium carbonate) reappears as stalactites.
  - Concrete surfaces slowly form a chalky skin when the fizz gas in air reacts with the calcium in concrete.

## Derive it from first principles (clear, causal, connected)

### 1) Everyday observation to chemical idea
- When you mix vinegar and baking soda, you see fizzing. Fizzing means a gas is being made and escaping.
- Vinegar is a sour liquid (an acid). Baking soda is a mild base. Acids and bases react by swapping H+ (a hydrogen ion).
- So the fizz likely comes from an acid–base reaction that releases a gas.

### 2) What are the particles actually present?
- Vinegar is mostly water with acetic acid, whose key behavior is to donate H+. We can write it simply as providing H+ to the water: CH3COOH ⇌ H+ + CH3COO− (weak acid).
- Baking soda is sodium hydrogencarbonate (bicarbonate): NaHCO3 → Na+ + HCO3− in water. The bicarbonate ion can accept H+.
- When H+ meets HCO3−, they form carbonic acid H2CO3, which is unstable in water and breaks into CO2 (a gas) and H2O.

Write this as stepwise, “particle-logic” equations:

```math
\text{Acid donates: } \quad \mathrm{CH_3COOH \to H^+ + CH_3COO^-}
```

```math
\text{Base accepts: } \quad \mathrm{H^+ + HCO_3^- \to H_2CO_3}
```

```math
\text{Unstable carbonic acid: } \quad \mathrm{H_2CO_3 \to CO_2\uparrow + H_2O}
```

Putting it together (including spectator Na+):

```math
\mathrm{CH_3COOH + NaHCO_3 \to CH_3COONa + H_2O + CO_2\uparrow}
```

So the gas is carbon dioxide, CO2.

Why does H2CO3 decompose? Two reasons reinforce each other:
- It can rearrange into very stable molecules CO2 and H2O.
- CO2 escapes as a gas, pulling the equilibrium toward more CO2 (Le Châtelier’s principle).

### 3) What does limewater do?
- Limewater is a clear, dilute solution of calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2(aq). It already contains Ca2+ and OH− ions.
- When CO2 bubbles through limewater, CO2 reacts with the hydroxide to make carbonate, which pairs with Ca2+ to create calcium carbonate, CaCO3.
- Calcium carbonate is only very slightly soluble in water and forms tiny solid particles (a precipitate) that scatter light, making the solution look milky.

Write the reaction simply as:

```math
\mathrm{CO_2 + Ca(OH)_2 \to CaCO_3\,(s)\downarrow + H_2O}
```

- “s” means solid; the downward arrow indicates a precipitate.
- Those suspended microscopic CaCO3 particles are what cause the visible milkiness.

Therefore, the milkiness is due to calcium carbonate.

### 4) Why not the other options?
- Calcium hydroxide (option 2) is the original limewater; it’s dissolved and clear. It doesn’t cause milkiness—CO2 consumes it to make CaCO3.
- Calcium bicarbonate (option 4), Ca(HCO3)2, is soluble. In fact, bubbling excess CO2 can dissolve the CaCO3 milkiness by forming Ca(HCO3)2:

```math
  \mathrm{CaCO_3\,(s) + CO_2 + H_2O \to Ca(HCO_3)_2\,(aq)}
  ```
  So bicarbonate clears the milkiness, it doesn’t cause it.
- Calcium oxalate (option 1) comes from oxalate ions (C2O4^2−), which aren’t present here. Vinegar has acetate, not oxalate.

## Final answer
Calcium carbonate (Option 3).

## Conceptual follow-up questions
1. If you keep bubbling CO2 into the milky limewater, why does the milkiness eventually disappear? Explain using the bicarbonate reaction.
2. How could you confirm the gas is CO2 without limewater? Think about a candle or pH indicator.
3. What would happen if you used distilled water instead of limewater? Would you get milkiness?
4. Why does CO2 escaping as a gas make the vinegar–baking soda reaction keep going?

## Application questions
- How do soda-lime CO2 scrubbers in submarines or spacecraft work, and how is that related to the limewater test?
- Stalactites and stalagmites in caves form from CaCO3. Explain how CO2 in rainwater helps dissolve limestone as bicarbonate and later re-forms CaCO3.
- Hard water often contains Ca(HCO3)2. How does heating cause “boiler scale” (CaCO3) to form?

## Common misconceptions and reasoning traps
- “Limewater is lime juice.” No—limewater is calcium hydroxide solution; lime the mineral, not the fruit.
- “The milkiness is foam from gas.” It’s not gas bubbles; it’s a solid precipitate of CaCO3 scattering light.
- “More CO2 makes more milkiness forever.” Excess CO2 actually dissolves the precipitate by forming soluble calcium bicarbonate.
- “Calcium hydroxide forms the milkiness.” Ca(OH)2 is already dissolved; it’s consumed to make CaCO3.

## Extension challenges
- Design an experiment to measure the amount of CO2 produced by a given mass of baking soda and vinegar using limewater: capture the precipitated CaCO3, dry it, and weigh it. Use mass balance to infer moles of CO2.
- Predict and test how temperature affects the limewater test’s speed and intensity (consider CO2 solubility and reaction kinetics).
- Write complete ionic and net ionic equations for both the vinegar–baking soda reaction and the limewater test. Track atom and charge conservation carefully.

## Reflective insight
At its core, this problem is about how matter rearranges to more stable forms and how we “see” invisible gases by making a visible, characteristic solid. An acid donates H+ to bicarbonate, releasing CO2; that CO2 then meets a solution that can trap it as an insoluble salt (CaCO3), creating a clear visual signal. Conservation of atoms, stability of products, and solubility rules together explain the entire chain from fizz to milkiness.
