# Question
Which statement among the following is incorrect?  
   1) Cinnabar, an alloy of mercury and sulphur (Hg and S), is an amalgam  
   2) 22 carat gold is an alloy. It is gold alloyed with either silver or copper  
   3) Brass an alloy of copper and zinc (Cu and Zn) is not a good conductor of electricity  
   4) Solder, an alloy of lead and tin (Pb and Sn), has low melting point

# Answer

## Start with a simple idea: mixing vs reacting

Think of two kitchen stories:
- Mixing nuts and raisins: you still see both, just blended. That’s an alloy: metals mixed together, atoms sharing a “sea of electrons,” but not forming a new chemical compound.
- Baking a cake: flour + eggs + sugar react and become something new. That’s a compound: atoms chemically bonded in fixed ratios with new properties.

With that picture, let’s test each statement.

## Evaluate each option

1) Cinnabar, an alloy of mercury and sulphur (Hg and S), is an amalgam  
- Why this is wrong: Cinnabar is mercury(II) sulphide, HgS — a chemical compound (like the cake), not a metal mixture. Also, an “amalgam” means an alloy where mercury mixes with another metal. Sulphur is a non-metal, so Hg + S gives a compound, not an alloy.  
- Verdict: Incorrect.

2) 22 carat gold is an alloy. It is gold alloyed with either silver or copper  
- Carat in gold means “how much of it is pure gold.” 24 carat = pure gold. 22 carat = 22 parts gold out of 24 (about 91.7%) and the rest is usually copper and/or silver to make it harder.  
- Verdict: Correct.

3) Brass, an alloy of copper and zinc (Cu and Zn), is not a good conductor of electricity  
- Pure copper is an excellent conductor. When you make an alloy like brass, the mixed atoms disturb the uniform metal lattice, so electrons scatter more and conductivity drops. Brass still conducts, but much worse than copper (roughly a quarter to a third as well). In school-level comparisons, we often say “alloys are poorer conductors than pure metals,” so calling brass “not a good conductor” is acceptable in that context.  
- Verdict: Correct in the exam sense (poorer conductor than copper; not used for power cables).

4) Solder, an alloy of lead and tin (Pb and Sn), has low melting point  
- This is exactly why solder is used to join wires and components. A common tin-lead solder melts around 183°C (low compared to most metals).  
- Verdict: Correct.

## Final Answer

Incorrect statement: 1

## Why this matters (built from fundamentals)

- Alloy = metallic mixture (nuts + raisins). No fixed formula, properties are averaged/modified.  
- Compound = chemical bond with fixed ratio (baked cake). Very different properties from elements.  
- Amalgam = special case of alloy with mercury + another metal (not non-metals).

Cinnabar (HgS) is the main ore of mercury, a red crystalline compound — definitely not an amalgam.

---

## Experimental view (how you’d test it)

- Cinnabar: Observe bright red crystals; heat in air → mercury vapor is released (shows it’s an ore/compound).  
- Brass conductivity: Measure resistance with a multimeter of equal-sized copper vs brass rods; brass shows significantly higher resistance.  
- Solder: Heat two metals with solder wire; watch it melt and flow at low temperature.

## 🧠 Quick Exam Tips
- Amalgam = mercury + a metal alloy.  
- Alloys usually conduct electricity worse than pure metals (more electron scattering).  
- Carat in gold: 24 = pure; 22 = alloyed (usually with Cu/Ag).  
- Cinnabar = HgS (compound), main ore of mercury.

## Misconception Clinic
- Many students think “anything with mercury is an amalgam.” But actually, amalgams are mercury mixed with metals. Mercury + sulphur gives a compound (HgS), not an alloy.  
- A common mistake is assuming “brass conducts well because it’s metallic.” While it does conduct, it’s much worse than copper; alloys generally have lower conductivity due to lattice disorder.  
- Some think “carat” is a mass unit for gold. In gold, carat measures purity, not mass.

---

## Conceptual follow-ups
- What if gold were 24 carat? Then it’s pure and very soft — not ideal for jewelry. Alloying (22 carat) improves hardness.  
- Why use brass for plugs and fittings if it’s less conductive? Strength, corrosion resistance, and decent (though not top-tier) conductivity make it practical and safe.

## Practice questions
1) Which is an amalgam?  
   a) Brass  
   b) Bronze  
   c) Dental filling (mercury + silver/tin)  
   d) Cinnabar  
   Answer: c

2) If you increase zinc content in brass, what likely happens to its electrical conductivity?  
   - It decreases (more scattering from disorder).

3) 18 carat gold means what percentage of gold?  
   - 75%

> Reflective essence: The same pattern appears everywhere — mixing changes behavior by introducing irregularity. In metals, irregularity scatters electrons; in materials, it changes strength; in systems, it changes flow. Understanding the mechanism beats memorizing the label.
