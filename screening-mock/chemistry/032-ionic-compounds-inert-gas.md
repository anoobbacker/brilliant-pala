# Answer

## Quick visual reasoning
Think of each row of the periodic table as a shelf with a “full stop” at the far right (the noble gas). Metals on the left roll backward to the last full stop; nonmetals near the right roll forward to the next full stop.

Check each compound by seeing where each ion lands:

- Calcium fluoride (CaF2)
  - Calcium is two spots past argon, so Ca2+ rolls back to argon.
  - Fluorine is one spot before neon, so F− rolls forward to neon.
  - Different full stops → not the same.

- Sodium chloride (NaCl)
  - Sodium is just past neon, so Na+ rolls back to neon.
  - Chlorine is just before argon, so Cl− rolls forward to argon.
  - Different full stops → not the same.

- Sodium oxide (Na2O)
  - Sodium is just past neon, so Na+ rolls back to neon.
  - Oxygen is two before neon, so O2− rolls forward to neon.
  - Same full stop (both neon) → match.

- Magnesium chloride (MgCl2)
  - Magnesium is two past neon, so Mg2+ rolls back to neon.
  - Chlorine is one before argon, so Cl− rolls forward to argon.
  - Different full stops → not the same.

Answer: Sodium oxide (Na2O).

## Create twists
- Typical traps
  - “If the ratio is 1:1, they must match.” Not true—NaCl is 1:1 but lands on neon vs argon.
  - “If both elements are in the same row, they match.” Often the opposite: the metal falls back, the nonmetal moves forward to different noble gases (as in NaCl).
  - “Bigger charge means same ending.” Charge size doesn’t tell you which noble gas; positions on the shelf do.

- Use the idea on different-looking problems
  - Quick spot rule: A metal just after a noble gas paired with a nonmetal just before that same noble gas will match. Examples:
    - NaF and MgO → both end up neon-like.
    - KCl and CaS → both end up argon-like.

- Seen in nature/engineering
  - Ions that “finish” on the same noble-gas shell often build very similar crystal patterns (like many rock-salt–type solids). That repeating, sturdy lattice is nature’s way of showing those filled shells are especially stable.

## Goal
Find which ionic compound has both its cation and anion ending up with the same noble gas (inert gas) electron configuration.

## Start with an everyday picture
Imagine atoms like people trying to fill seats in a small cinema row called the “outer shell.” Noble gases are the “already-perfect seating plans.” Other atoms will give away or take seats (electrons) to copy the nearest perfect plan. That’s what ions do in ionic (electrovalent) compounds.

Key idea: After transfer, each ion wants a noble-gas-like electron count. But “octet” doesn’t always mean they become the same noble gas. You must check the actual number of electrons.

## Rebuild from fundamentals
- Metals lose electrons → become positively charged (cations) → drop back to the previous noble gas.
- Nonmetals gain electrons → become negatively charged (anions) → move forward to the next noble gas.

Compute electrons in an ion by:
```math
\text{Electrons in ion} = Z \pm \text{charge}
```
- Use “−” for cations (lost electrons), “+” for anions (gained electrons).
- Then match that number to a noble gas: He (2), Ne (10), Ar (18), Kr (36), …

## Check each option step-by-step

1) Calcium fluoride, CaF2
- Ca → Ca2+: 20 − 2 = 18 electrons → [Ar]
- F → F−: 9 + 1 = 10 electrons → [Ne]
- Not the same.

2) Sodium chloride, NaCl
- Na → Na+: 11 − 1 = 10 electrons → [Ne]
- Cl → Cl−: 17 + 1 = 18 electrons → [Ar]
- Not the same.

3) Sodium oxide, Na2O
- Na → Na+: 11 − 1 = 10 electrons → [Ne]
- O → O2−: 8 + 2 = 10 electrons → [Ne]
- Same noble gas (both Ne). ✓

4) Magnesium chloride, MgCl2
- Mg → Mg2+: 12 − 2 = 10 electrons → [Ne]
- Cl → Cl−: 17 + 1 = 18 electrons → [Ar]
- Not the same.

Answer: 3) Sodium oxide (Na2O)

## Intuition builder: How to predict quickly
- Group 1 metals (like Na, K) go back 1 electron to the previous noble gas.
- Group 2 metals (like Mg, Ca) go back 2.
- Group 16 nonmetals (like O, S) go forward 2.
- Group 17 nonmetals (like F, Cl) go forward 1.

To have “same noble gas,” both ions must land on the same target. Example patterns:
- Na+ and O2− → both Ne (works)
- Mg2+ and O2− → both Ne (works, e.g., MgO)
- K+ and Cl− → both Ar (works, e.g., KCl)

Counterexamples:
- Ca2+ and F− → Ar vs Ne (don’t match)
- Na+ and Cl− → Ne vs Ar (don’t match)

> - Don’t stop at “octet.” Check which noble gas each ion matches.

## Conceptual follow-ups
- What if we replace Na with K in NaCl? KCl: K+ has 19 − 1 = 18 → [Ar]; Cl− also 18 → [Ar]. Now they match.
- Why doesn’t CaO match? Ca2+ → 18 [Ar], O2− → 10 [Ne]. Different noble gases.

---

## Experimental lens
In a lab, you can’t “see” electron configurations directly, but periodic trends and known charges (Na+1, Mg+2, O−2, Cl−1) reliably predict these noble gas endpoints, which correlate with lattice stability and typical ionic radii.

---

## Misconception clinic
- Many students think “both reach octet, so they’re the same.” But actually, Ne and Ar are both octets, yet different electron counts (10 vs 18).
- A common mistake is assuming all compounds of a metal with a nonmetal give the same noble gas to both ions. It depends on the period (row) as well as the group.

---

## Extension challenges
- Chemistry to materials: The ion sizes (Ne-like vs Ar-like) affect crystal packing and melting points. Compare Na2O vs CaO structures and properties.
- Cross-discipline: This is like modular arithmetic—different start points but same “target class” (noble gas) after adding/subtracting electrons.

## Interactive practice
1) Which pairs have both ions with the same noble gas?
   a) MgO  b) LiF  c) KCl  d) Na2S
- Answers: a) MgO (both Ne), c) KCl (both Ar). LiF: He vs Ne; Na2S: Ne vs Ar.

2) Predict for K2O: K+ → 18 (Ar), O2− → 10 (Ne). Same? No.

3) Predict for CaS: Ca2+ → 18 (Ar), S2− → 18 (Ar). Same? Yes.
