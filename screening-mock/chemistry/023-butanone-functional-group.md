   2) Carboxylic acid  
   3) Aldehyde  
   4) Alcohol

# Answer

## Quick visual reasoning
- Picture a 4-bead carbon chain: bead–bead–bead–bead.
- “Butanone” ends with “-one.” Think “one eye in the middle”: a double-bonded oxygen sticking to an inside bead, not the end.
- If the double-oxygen is on an inside carbon with carbons on both sides, that’s a ketone.
- Aldehyde would have the double-oxygen on an end bead with a hydrogen there.
- Carboxylic acid would look like a fork at the end: one double-oxygen plus an -OH.
- Alcohol would be just an -OH on any bead, no double-oxygen.

Answer: 1) Ketone.

## Create twists
- Common trap: mixing “-one” and “-ol.” “-one” = middle double-oxygen (ketone). “-ol” = just -OH (alcohol).
- Butanal vs butanone: “-al” means the double-oxygen sits at the end (aldehyde). “-one” means it sits in the middle (ketone).
- Different-looking problem: “Propanone” uses the same picture—3 beads with the double-oxygen on the center bead → ketone.
- In the real world: Nail-polish remover (acetone) is a classic ketone—oxygen double-bond on a middle carbon, balanced by carbons on both sides.

## What does “butanone” really tell us?

Start with a familiar picture: nail polish remover often smells like acetone — that’s a ketone. Butanone is in the same family. How can we see that just from the name?

Names in organic chemistry are like compressed instructions. If you “unpack” them, you can rebuild the structure and the functional group.

### Step 1: Decode the name

- “but-” means 4 carbons in the main chain.
- “-an-” means only single bonds along the carbon chain (no C=C or C≡C in the backbone).
- “-one” means there is a carbonyl group C=O placed inside the chain, not at the end. That “inside-the-chain” carbonyl is the defining feature of a ketone.

Technical term introduced: 
- Carbonyl group: a carbon double-bonded to oxygen (C=O).
- Ketone: carbonyl carbon attached to two carbons.
- Aldehyde: carbonyl at the end, attached to at least one hydrogen.
- Carboxylic acid: carbonyl with an -OH on the same carbon (–COOH).
- Alcohol: contains –OH attached to a carbon (no carbonyl involved).

```math
\text{ketone: } R{-}CO{-}R' \qquad
\text{aldehyde: } R{-}CHO \qquad
\text{carboxylic acid: } R{-}COOH \qquad
\text{alcohol: } R{-}OH
```

### Step 2: Build the structure of butanone

If the 4-carbon chain has a carbonyl inside, it must be on carbon 2 (the middle), otherwise it would be at the end and become an aldehyde.

Text sketch (each dash is a bond):
CH3–CO–CH2–CH3

That is butan-2-one (commonly just called butanone). The carbonyl carbon (C=O) has carbons on both sides → ketone.

Therefore, the correct class is: 1) Ketone.

## Analytical view: Why this must be a ketone

- A ketone’s carbonyl must have two carbon neighbors.
- In a 4-carbon straight chain, placing C=O at C-2 gives exactly that.
- Placing it at C-1 would give CH3–CH2–CH2–CHO (butanal), which is an aldehyde, not a ketone.

---

## Experimental view: How would you confirm it in a lab?

- 2,4-DNPH test: positive for carbonyls (both ketones and aldehydes).
- Tollens’/Fehling’s test: negative for ketones, positive for aldehydes. Butanone would be negative → supports ketone.
- Reaction with NaHCO3: effervescence for acids (CO2 gas), not for ketones → no fizz for butanone.
- Sodium metal: alcohols react (hydrogen gas), ketones don’t.

## Intuitive shortcuts you can trust

- Suffix maps:
  - “-one” → ketone
  - “-al” → aldehyde
  - “-oic acid” → carboxylic acid
  - “-ol” → alcohol
- A ketone’s C=O is “inside” the carbon chain; an aldehyde’s is “at the edge.”

> ### 🧠 Quick Exam Tips
> - The suffix is a dead giveaway: “-one” = ketone.
> - For 4 carbons, the only ketone position is 2 → butan-2-one.
> - Ketone fails Tollens’/Fehling’s; aldehyde passes.

## Misconception clinic

- Many students think “any C=O means aldehyde.” Actually, position matters: inside the chain (ketone), at the end (aldehyde).
- A common mistake is assuming “butanone” could be “butan-1-one.” That can’t be a ketone; a terminal carbonyl at C-1 would be an aldehyde (butanal).

## Mini practice (fast reasoning)

- Ethanol → alcohol (–ol).
- Pentanal → aldehyde (–al).
- Propanone → ketone (–one).
- Ethanoic acid → carboxylic acid (–oic acid).

Challenge: Draw the structure of pentan-2-one and mark the carbonyl carbon. Is it a ketone or aldehyde? Why?

Final answer: 1) Ketone.
