## Answer with First-Principles Reasoning

Plaster of Paris is the white powder used to make casts and sculptures. When you add water, it quickly turns into a hard solid. Why?

### Step 1: Start from everyday observation
- Dry powder + water → it sets hard.
- If it’s not just “drying,” it can harden even under water. So the hardening must come from a chemical change inside, not simple evaporation.

### Step 2: What is inside the powder?
Most common building salts are “hydrated” — they have water locked into their crystal structure. This water is called “water of crystallization.” It’s not wet like liquid water; it’s part of the solid’s structure, like scaffolding in a building.

- Gypsum (a natural mineral) has the formula:
  

```math
  \text{Gypsum: } CaSO_4 \cdot 2H_2O
  ```
  
  This means: calcium sulfate plus 2 water molecules per unit.

- If you gently heat gypsum (about 120–180°C), some of that water is removed, but not all. The crystal becomes “half-hydrated,” called Plaster of Paris:
  

```math
  CaSO_4 \cdot 2H_2O \xrightarrow{\text{heat}} CaSO_4 \cdot \tfrac{1}{2}H_2O + \tfrac{3}{2}H_2O \uparrow
  ```
  
  So Plaster of Paris is:
  

```math
  \text{Plaster of Paris (POP): } CaSO_4 \cdot \tfrac{1}{2}H_2O
  ```

Think of it like a sponge that has been partially dried — still the same framework, but missing some “structural water.”

### Step 3: What happens when we add water back?
If heating removed 1.5 waters per formula unit, then adding water back should rebuild gypsum. The reverse process is:

```math
CaSO_4 \cdot \tfrac{1}{2}H_2O + \tfrac{3}{2}H_2O \longrightarrow CaSO_4 \cdot 2H_2O
```

- This is a rehydration reaction: the half-hydrate takes up 1.5 water molecules to become the dihydrate (gypsum).
- As it forms, tiny needle-like crystals of gypsum grow and interlock, turning the paste solid.
- The process releases heat (it feels slightly warm) because forming crystals lowers energy — it’s exothermic.

So the setting is due to crystallization of gypsum, not drying.

### Step 4: Check by stoichiometry (cause-effect and proportion)
- One “mole” of POP needs 1.5 moles of water to become gypsum.
- That precise ratio explains why adding too little water leaves powdery patches, while too much slows setting — the chemistry wants exactly enough water to rebuild gypsum’s structure.

### Step 5: Eliminate the wrong options by chemistry identity
- Limestone is calcium carbonate, $CaCO_3$ — unrelated to sulfates and not formed by adding water.
- Quicklime is calcium oxide, $CaO$ — you get it by heating limestone strongly; adding water to quicklime gives slaked lime, not related here.
- Bleaching powder (commonly written $CaOCl_2$ in school texts) involves chlorine chemistry, not sulfate.
- Only gypsum, $CaSO_4 \cdot 2H_2O$, is the rehydrated form of Plaster of Paris.

### Conclusion
Plaster of Paris + water → Gypsum.

Correct option: 1. Gypsum


## Multiple Ways to See It

- Intuitive: Powder + water hardens even underwater → crystallization, not drying.
- Structural: Half-hydrate + water rebuilds the dihydrate lattice.
- Experimental: Measure temperature rise (exothermic), mass gain (water uptake), and hardness increase (crystal interlocking).
- Reversible process: Manufacture POP by partially dehydrating gypsum; setting is just the reverse.

```math
\text{Forward (making POP): } CaSO_4 \cdot 2H_2O \to CaSO_4 \cdot \tfrac{1}{2}H_2O + \tfrac{3}{2}H_2O
\text{Reverse (setting): } CaSO_4 \cdot \tfrac{1}{2}H_2O + \tfrac{3}{2}H_2O \to CaSO_4 \cdot 2H_2O
```


## Conceptual Follow-Up Questions

1. If POP hardens by crystallization, will it still set under water? Why?
2. What happens to the setting time if the room is colder or warmer? Consider crystal growth rates and solubility.
3. If you add salt or potassium sulfate to the mix, why might setting speed up? Think about nucleation sites for crystals.
4. Why does too much water make the final object weaker, even though it still sets?

## Application Questions

- Medical casts: Why is POP ideal for setting broken bones? Consider moldability, exothermic heat limits, and dimensional stability.
- Architecture: In ornate ceiling designs, why is POP preferred over cement for fine detail?
- 3D printing with gypsum: How does controlled rehydration allow layered manufacturing?

## Common Misconceptions and Traps

- “It hardens because water evaporates.” Reality: It hardens by forming gypsum crystals; it can set underwater.
- “More water = better setting.” Excess water increases porosity after it leaves, making the solid weaker.
- “Any heating makes POP.” Overheating can drive off too much water, producing anhydrite (dead-burned plaster) that sets very slowly.
- “Bleaching powder is CaOCl2 exactly.” In reality, it’s a mixture containing Ca(OCl)Cl and CaCl2; either way, unrelated to POP chemistry.

## Extension Challenges

- Quantitative: Calculate how many grams of water are theoretically needed to set 100 g of POP, assuming pure CaSO4·½H2O.
- Thermal: Design a simple experiment to measure the temperature rise during setting and estimate the enthalpy change per mole.
- Microstructure: Use microscopy images (research online) to relate needle-like gypsum crystals to the macroscopic strength of set plaster.
- Materials design: Propose additives that could make POP set slower (retarders like borax) or faster (accelerators like K2SO4), and explain why.

## Reflective Insight

At its core, Plaster of Paris is a lesson in reversible crystal chemistry: a partially dehydrated solid that “remembers” its full structure. Add just enough water, and the lattice rebuilds itself, releasing heat and creating an interlocked crystal network. Understanding this cause-effect chain — structure → rehydration → crystallization → strength — lets you predict behavior in many materials that harden by similar transformations, from cements to hydrates in batteries.

Final answer: Gypsum (Option 1).
