# Answer

## Quick visual reasoning
- Picture each oil molecule as a chain with a few “open hinges” (double gaps) along it. These gaps make the chain kinked and bendy.
- During hydrogenation, tiny hydrogen pieces are brought in on a catalyst “workbench.” The catalyst just helps them meet; it doesn’t get used up.
- The hydrogen pieces snap onto those open hinges, filling them. The chain straightens and packs tighter, turning a runny oil into something more solid.
- Key clue: nothing is kicked out or replaced. We simply add onto the chain. That’s an addition reaction.
- It’s not substitution (nothing swapped out), not oxidation (no oxygen joining; in fact, hydrogen is being added), and not combustion (no flame or burning to gases).

Answer: 2) Addition reaction

## Create twists
- Common trap: “Hydrogen is involved, so it must be combustion or oxidation.” Quick check: Is oxygen present with fire and smoke? No. Are we replacing a part? No. We’re just filling empty hooks—so it’s addition.
- Another look-alike problem: When a colored halogen solution loses its color with a double-bonded molecule, the color fades because the halogen pieces add across the open hinge—again, addition, since nothing leaves.
- In the real world: Turning liquid oil into spreadable margarine. The chains straighten and pack like neatly stacked pencils after their kinks are clipped—made possible by hydrogen adding across the gaps.

## What kind of reaction is hydrogenation of vegetable oils?

### Start with a real-world picture
Why is liquid vegetable oil turned into spreadable margarine? Because we “smooth out the kinks” in the oil molecules so they can pack closer and become more solid. How do we do that? We make the molecule grab onto hydrogen.

### Build from fundamentals
- Vegetable oils contain many carbon–carbon double bonds (C=C). These “double-bond kinks” stop the molecules from packing tightly, so the oil is liquid.
- In hydrogenation, we pass hydrogen gas (H2) over the oil with a metal catalyst (often Ni). The hydrogen atoms attach directly across the double bond, turning it into a single bond.

Mechanism in simple terms:
- A C=C double bond has a weaker, more exposed part (the pi bond).
- Hydrogen splits and adds to each of the two carbons.
- The double bond becomes a single bond (C–C), and each carbon gains a hydrogen.

Symbolically:
```math
R-CH=CH-R' + H_2 \xrightarrow{\text{Ni, Pt}} R-CH_2-CH_2-R'
```

That is the definition of an addition reaction: new atoms are added across a multiple bond without removing anything else.

## Which option is correct?

- Substitution reaction: one group is replaced by another (swap). Not happening here.
- Addition reaction: atoms add across a double bond. Yes — this is exactly what hydrogenation does.
- Oxidation reaction: generally adds oxygen or removes hydrogen. Here we add hydrogen, so it’s actually reduction, not oxidation.
- Combustion reaction: rapid reaction with oxygen producing CO2 and H2O with lots of heat. Not the case.

Answer: 2) Addition reaction

## Why catalysts are used (intuitive view)
Hydrogen and the double bond won’t react quickly on their own. The metal surface (like Ni) temporarily “holds” the hydrogen and the alkene, making it easier for H–H to split and for H atoms to attach to the carbons. The catalyst lowers the activation energy, speeding up the addition without being consumed.

## Experimental view
- Before hydrogenation: oil is liquid; bromine water decolorizes quickly (many C=C).
- After hydrogenation: oil becomes more solid; bromine decolorization decreases; iodine value drops (fewer C=C).

> - Hydrogenation of oils is an Addition reaction (also a Reduction: adding hydrogen).
> - Catalyst commonly used: Ni (also Pt/Pd).
> - Unsaturated → more saturated; melting point increases; liquid → more solid.

## Misconception Clinic
- Many students think “more oxygen in the air heater = combustion,” so hydrogenation must be combustion. But hydrogenation uses hydrogen gas, not oxygen, and no CO2/H2O are formed.
- A common mistake is calling it oxidation because “it reacts.” But adding hydrogen is reduction, not oxidation.
- Another confusion: substitution vs addition. In substitution, something gets swapped out. Here, nothing leaves; hydrogen is simply added across C=C.

## Quick practice
- If you add bromine (Br2) to an alkene, what type of reaction is it? Addition — Br atoms add across the C=C.
- If chlorine replaces a hydrogen in methane under UV light, what type? Substitution (free-radical substitution).

> “Big pattern”: Breaking a double bond to attach new atoms is addition. If those atoms are hydrogen, you’ve both done addition and achieved reduction. Understanding the bond changes tells you the reaction type without memorizing labels.
