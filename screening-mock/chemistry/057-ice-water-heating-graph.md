# Answer
Option 4

## Quick visual reasoning
- Picture a glass with ice cubes floating in water. You can pour in gentle warmth, but the thermometer stays stuck at “ice-cold” until the last cube disappears. Why? The heat is busy untying the ice’s crystal structure, not making the water hotter.
- So at first, temperature sits flat at the ice-water mark.
- After the final bit of ice melts, there’s only liquid. Now the same heat can actually nudge the thermometer up smoothly.

That’s a flat line at the start, then a rising line: Option 4.

## Create twists
- Visual traps:
  - Option 1: rises immediately—wrong because ice + water should hold the temperature steady first.
  - Option 2: slopes down—looks like cooling, not heating.
  - Option 3: has a flat part but then slopes the wrong way; also doesn’t clearly show “flat first, then rise.”

- Same idea, different look:
  - Only water (no ice): the line rises right away—no flat start.
  - Only ice below the ice-water mark: first it climbs to that mark, then sits flat while melting, then rises.
  - Heat long enough: after warming, you’d later see another flat part at the steam-water mark when boiling starts.

- Where you see this in life:
  - Iced drinks stay at “ice-cold” until the last cube melts, then warm up quickly.
  - Ice packs keep injuries at a steady chill for a while before warming.
  - Snow on a sunny day lingers at the melting point: energy goes into melting, not warming.

## Correct choice
Option 4

## Why (built from first principles)

### 1) Start from an everyday observation
- If you have a mix of ice and water together, the thermometer reads about 0°C and stays there until all the ice is gone. You can try this: keep stirring a glass with both ice and water. The temperature hardly changes while ice remains.

Why? Because temperature is “how fast, on average, particles jiggle” (their kinetic energy). Melting, however, is about breaking the “handshakes” (bonds) that lock molecules into a solid pattern. Heat added during melting goes into undoing those handshakes (potential energy), not into making the particles jiggle faster. So the temperature stays constant.

This “heat that changes the state without changing temperature” is called latent heat. We don’t assume this; we infer it from the observation that temperature doesn’t rise during melting despite heating.

### 2) Energy bookkeeping: what the heater is doing
- A heater supplies energy steadily. If its power is P (energy per second), then in time t it delivers:
```math
Q = P\,t
```
- Where does this energy go?
  1) While ice is still present: into melting (rearranging structure), not into raising temperature.
  2) After all ice has melted: into making the liquid water molecules jiggle faster, so temperature rises.

### 3) Why a flat line at 0°C first (the “plateau”)
- During melting, the required energy is proportional to how much ice must be melted. If the mass of ice is m_ice and the “energy per kg to melt” is L_f (latent heat of fusion), then the total energy to finish melting is:
```math
Q_{\text{melt}} = m_{\text{ice}}\,L_f
```
- Since the heater gives energy at rate P, the time spent at 0°C is:
```math
t_{\text{melt}} = \frac{Q_{\text{melt}}}{P} = \frac{m_{\text{ice}}\,L_f}{P}
```
- That creates the horizontal “====” at 0°C in Option 4: the temperature stays flat at 0°C until that time has elapsed.

Dimensional check: [L_f]=J/kg, [P]=J/s, so [m_ice L_f/P]=(kg·J/kg)/(J/s)=s. Good.

### 4) Why a straight rising line after the ice is gone
Once only liquid water remains, the same energy now increases the jiggling (kinetic energy), hence temperature. From proportional reasoning:
- Twice the mass takes twice the energy to raise the same number of degrees.
- Twice the temperature rise takes twice the energy for the same mass.
This motivates defining a “specific heat capacity” c (energy per kg per °C). Then:
```math
Q = m\,c\,\Delta T
```
With steady heating Q = P t, so after melting finishes (start a new clock at that moment):
```math
\Delta T = \frac{P}{m\,c}\,t
```
That is a straight line: temperature increases at a constant rate (slope = P/(m c)). That’s the “/” part of Option 4.

Dimensional check: [P/(m c)] = (J/s)/(kg·J/(kg·K)) = K/s. So it’s a temperature rise per second, as expected.

### 5) What about 100°C?
If you keep heating long enough, water reaches 100°C (at normal atmospheric pressure) and then boils. During boiling, temperature again plateaus while energy goes into escaping the liquid (latent heat of vaporization). Option 4 doesn’t show that further plateau—likely because the question only focuses on the ice-water start: first a 0°C plateau, then a rise. If we extended the time axis further, we’d expect a second flat segment at 100°C.

## Why the other options are incorrect
- Option 1: Temperature rises immediately from 0°C with no 0°C plateau. That would be pure water heating from 0°C, not a water–ice mixture finishing its melt.
- Option 2: Starts flat at 100°C and then cools. That’s the opposite situation (cooling/condensing/then cooling), not heating ice–water.
- Option 3: Shows cooling from 100°C down to 0°C and then a 0°C plateau (freezing), which is again a cooling process, not heating.

## Multiple lenses to understand it
- Particle model: Added heat first breaks the rigid ice structure (no extra jiggle speed → no temperature rise), then later makes molecules jiggle faster (temperature rises).
- Energy-rate model: Constant power P into the system; if energy goes into phase change, dT/dt=0; if energy goes into sensible heating, dT/dt=P/(mc), a constant.

## Experimental way to verify
- Put crushed ice and water in a beaker, insert a thermometer, stir gently for uniform temperature, and heat with a constant-power source (same flame/setting).
- Record T vs time. You will see:
  - A flat segment at 0°C (duration depends on how much ice you started with).
  - Then a straight-line rise in temperature after the last ice cube disappears.

## Compact mathematical picture
Let t=0 when heating begins, and let t_melt be when the last ice melts.
```math
T(t) =
\begin{cases}
0^\circ\text{C}, & 0 \le t \le t_{\text{melt}}\\
\frac{P}{m c}\,(t - t_{\text{melt}}), & t > t_{\text{melt}}
\end{cases}
```

## 1) Conceptual follow-up questions
- If you start with more ice (same heater), what changes in the graph? Why?
- If you double the heater power, how does the plateau duration and the slope after melting change?
- Could the temperature rise during melting if you didn’t stir? What would be the hidden reason if a thermometer near the bottom reads slightly different?
- How would the graph change at high altitude (lower atmospheric pressure), especially near boiling?

## 2) Application questions
- How do ice packs keep drinks at nearly 0°C for a long time? Explain using the 0°C plateau and latent heat.
- Why do coastal climates have milder temperatures? Connect the idea of large water bodies absorbing/releasing heat (high c) and using latent heat.
- In data centers, why are phase-change materials used for thermal management? Sketch the expected temperature-time behavior under a sudden heat load.

## 3) Common misconceptions and how to avoid them
- Misconception: “If you are heating, temperature must always rise.” Reality: During phase changes, heat changes structure, not temperature.
- Misconception: “The graph should always be curved.” Reality: With constant power and constant c, temperature rises linearly outside phase changes.
- Misconception: “Boiling water gets hotter than 100°C in an open pot.” At 1 atm, bulk boiling water stays near 100°C; extra heat goes into vaporizing, not raising T. (Exceptions: superheating in a microwave or pressure changes.)

## 4) Extension challenges
- Given a measured graph with a 0°C plateau of 4.0 minutes using a 200 W heater and 50 g of ice present, estimate the latent heat of fusion L_f.
- Design an experiment using the slope of the warming line to estimate water’s specific heat capacity c with only a stopwatch, thermometer, and known heater power.
- Explore mixtures: How does adding salt (which lowers the melting point) change the shape and position of the plateau?

## 5) Reflective insight
The essence: Temperature tracks average kinetic energy, but not all energy given to a system increases kinetic energy. During phase changes, energy rearranges the structure (potential energy) while kinetic energy—and thus temperature—stays nearly the same. On a T–time graph with constant heating, that principle becomes visible as plateaus (structure-changing energy) connected by straight lines (kinetic-energy-changing). Recognizing this energy bookkeeping lets you predict and explain many thermal phenomena confidently.
