# Answer
## Quick visual reasoning
Think of each sample as a jar of beads:
- Pure substance: every bead looks the same.
- Mixture: different kinds of beads mixed together (even if the mix looks uniform to your eyes).

Now scan each item:

- i) Ice — solid water; imagine identical water particles locked in place. Pure.
- ii) Milk — tiny fat droplets and proteins floating in water; many kinds of particles. Mixture.
- iii) 24 Carat gold — “nothing else mixed” gold; one kind of particle. Pure.
- iv) Calcium oxide — a single compound; all units identical. Pure.
- v) Mercury — a single metal as a liquid; one kind of particle. Pure.
- vi) Air — a blend of several gases; different kinds together. Mixture.
- vii) Vinegar — sour component dissolved in water; strength can vary. Mixture.
- viii) Gold amalgam — gold mixed with mercury (an alloy). Mixture.

Count of pure substances: 4 (i, iii, iv, v).

## Create twists
- Visual trap: “Looks uniform, so it must be pure.” Not true. Air and vinegar look uniform but hide different particles mixed evenly.
- Visual trap: “Shiny metal must be pure.” Alloys like amalgam are shiny yet mixed.
- Naming trap: “Ice from tap water isn’t perfectly pure.” True in practice, but in science class “ice” means solid water only, so pure.

Use the same idea elsewhere:
- Is steel pure? No—iron mixed with other elements (alloy).
- Is distilled water pure? Yes. Is seawater pure? No—water plus salts.
- Clear sugar solution? Mixture—sugar particles dissolved among water particles.

Seen in nature/engineering:
- Fractional distillation of air separates its different gases—proves air is a mixture.
- Cream rising or being spun off from milk shows milk contains different parts.
- Refining gold to 24 carat aims for one kind of particle—purity.

## Big idea
When you pick any tiny piece of a pure substance, it’s exactly the same as any other piece—same kind of building block (atoms or molecules), in the same fixed ratio, giving the same sharp melting/boiling points. A mixture is like a smoothie: different ingredients blended together; the proportions can vary, and properties like boiling point “smear” over a range.

- Pure substances can be:
  - Elements (only one kind of atom, like mercury).
  - Compounds (one kind of molecule with a fixed recipe, like water H2O).
- Mixtures can look uniform (homogeneous: air, vinegar) or visibly mixed (heterogeneous: milk).

Experimental fingerprint:
- Pure substance: single, sharp melting/boiling point (at a given pressure).
- Mixture: melting/boiling over a range; components can be separated by physical methods.

```math
\text{Pure substance} \Rightarrow \text{single chemical identity + fixed composition}
```

## Classifying each item, from first principles

### i) Ice
- What is it really? Solid water: identical molecules repeating in a crystal.
- Water’s “recipe” is fixed: two H for every O.

```math
\text{Water molecule: } \mathrm{H_2O} \quad (\text{H:O} = 2:1 \text{ always})
```

- Physical test: at 1 atm, pure ice melts sharply at 0°C. A mixture would melt over a range.
- Conclusion: Ice (ideal, pure H2O) is a pure substance (a compound).
  - Note: Natural ice can trap air, but in textbook classification “ice” means pure solid water.

### ii) Milk
- What is it? Water + fats + proteins + sugars + minerals—tiny fat droplets dispersed in water (a colloid).
- Variable composition (depends on animal, diet, processing).
- No single sharp boiling/melting point; shows Tyndall effect because of dispersed particles.
- Conclusion: Mixture, not pure.

### iii) 24 Carat gold
- “Carat” measures how much of the material is gold. 24k means all 24 parts are gold—no other metals mixed in.
- Single type of atom (Au). Uniform properties; fixed melting point at 1064°C.
- Conclusion: Pure substance (an element).
  - Real-world note: 24k is ~99.9% Au; in basic chemistry we treat it as pure.

### iv) Calcium oxide
- Chemical identity: one Ca bonded to one O, always 1:1.

```math
\mathrm{Ca}:\mathrm{O} = 1:1 \quad \text{(the compound } \mathrm{CaO)}
```

- A compound with a fixed formula and characteristic properties.
- Conclusion: Pure substance (a compound).

### v) Mercury
- Single type of atom (Hg), liquid metal at room temperature.
- Fixed melting/boiling points; cannot vary composition without adding something else.
- Conclusion: Pure substance (an element).

### vi) Air
- What is it? Mostly N2 and O2, plus Ar, CO2, water vapor, etc.
- Proportions vary by place, time, humidity.
- Uniform to the eye but still a mixture (a solution of gases).
- Conclusion: Mixture, not pure.

### vii) Vinegar
- Household vinegar is acetic acid dissolved in water (about 5–8% by volume).
- Variable concentration; properties change with dilution.
- Conclusion: Mixture (homogeneous solution), not pure.

### viii) Gold amalgam
- An amalgam is a solution of a metal in mercury (here, gold in mercury).
- Composition can vary (more or less gold).
- Conclusion: Mixture (alloy/solution), not pure.

## Count
- Pure substances: i) Ice, iii) 24 Carat gold, iv) Calcium oxide, v) Mercury
- Total pure substances = 4

```math
\boxed{4}
```

## Why these choices make causal sense
- “Pure” means one kind of building block repeated; mixtures combine multiple kinds in variable ratios.
- Fixed microscopic makeup causes fixed macroscopic behavior (sharp melting points, characteristic densities, etc.).
- If a sample’s identity can be described by a single chemical formula or element symbol, it’s pure; if it needs a recipe or percentage, it’s a mixture.

## Experimental viewpoint (how you’d test it)
- Melting/boiling point test: a pure substance shows a plateau at a specific temperature; mixtures do not.
- Chromatography: milk separates into components; vinegar splits into water and acetic acid; air separates by fractional distillation.
- Tyndall effect: milk scatters light (colloid), vinegar and air do not (true solutions), but both are still mixtures.
- Chemical formula test:
  - Water: H2O fixed.
  - Calcium oxide: CaO fixed.
  - Gold, mercury: Au, Hg fixed.
  - Air/vinegar/amalgam: need compositions, not single formulas.

```math
\text{Electrolysis shows water’s fixed composition: }
\mathrm{2H_2O(l) \rightarrow 2H_2(g) + O_2(g)}
\quad \text{(always 2:1 by volume for } H_2:O_2\text{)}
```

## Conceptual follow-up questions
1. Is dry ice (solid CO2) a pure substance? Why?
2. Sea water looks uniform. Is it pure? What single experiment could convince you?
3. Steel is strong and uniform. Is it a pure substance or a mixture? Explain.
4. If you add salt to ice and it melts at a lower temperature, what does that reveal about purity and melting points?
5. Can a mixture ever have a sharp melting point? Under what special conditions?

## Application questions
- Why must pharmaceuticals use pure substances and not mixtures with variable composition?
- How do industries use the “sharp boiling point” property to purify chemicals (e.g., fractional distillation of air to get liquid oxygen and nitrogen)?
- Why are alloys (intentional mixtures) preferred for building airplanes rather than pure metals?

## Common misconceptions and reasoning traps
- “Homogeneous = pure.” Not always. Air and vinegar are homogeneous but mixtures.
- “Natural = pure.” Natural samples (ice, water, minerals) often contain impurities.
- “If it’s one phase, it’s pure.” Single phase can still be a mixture (solutions, alloys).
- “24k gold isn’t pure because it’s 99.9%.” In educational classification, 24k is treated as pure; trace impurities don’t define the category.

How to avoid them: Ask, “Can I name a single chemical formula/element for this? Does it have a fixed, not variable, composition?”

## Extension challenges
- Design an experiment to check if “distilled water” is pure using only a thermometer, hot plate, and beaker.
- Given two clear liquids with identical appearance, outline a plan to decide which is pure: boiling point measurement, conductivity test, density, and refractive index.
- Analyze whether rubbing alcohol from a pharmacy (often 70% isopropanol) is a pure substance; propose a purification method and the physical principle behind it.
- For each: bronze, brass, quartz, graphite—classify as element/compound/mixture and justify experimentally.

## Reflective insight
The essence: Purity is about identity and invariance. When matter is made of just one kind of microscopic building block in a fixed pattern or formula, the macroscopic properties lock into precise values (sharp phase-change temperatures, characteristic spectra). Mixtures blur that identity, so their properties smear with composition. If you can name a single chemical formula or element and predict a single melting/boiling point, you’re looking at a pure substance.
