# Question
Formula unit mass is calculated the same way as molecular mass is calculated. The formula unit mass of aluminium sulphate is  .......... u. (Given: Atomic mass of H = 1u, N = 14u, O = 16u, S = 32u, Al = 27u, Na = 23u)

---
# Answer

## Quick visual reasoning
- Think of aluminium ions as +++ magnets and sulphate groups as -- magnets. To make a calm, neutral “bundle,” you need two +++ (2 aluminium) and three -- (3 sulphate). So the “recipe” is Al2 with three SO4 groups.
- Picture the bundle as:
  - 2 aluminium atoms
  - 3 copies of a sulphate “flower,” each with 1 sulphur at the center and 4 oxygens as petals.
- Add weights using the given masses:
  - Aluminium: 27 each → 27 + 27 = 54
  - One sulphate flower: sulphur 32 + four oxygens (4 × 16 = 64) → 32 + 64 = 96
  - Three such flowers: 96 + 96 + 96 = 288
  - Total bundle: 54 + 288 = 342 u

Answer: 342 u

## Create twists
- Visual traps to avoid:
  - Forgetting the bracket multiplies the whole flower: 3 sulphate groups means 3 sulphurs and 12 oxygens (not just adding 3 to oxygen).
  - Mixing in the extra numbers given (H, N, Na). They’re just decoys; aluminium sulphate uses Al, S, O only.
  - Treating it like one Al and one SO4. The charges don’t balance then; two +++ need three -- to settle.
- Same idea, different look:
  - Sodium nitrate: one sodium stuck to one nitrate flower (NO3). Count Na once and the NO3 group once, then add their given masses.
  - Ammonium sulphate: two ammonium “balls” balance one sulphate flower; count parts in each group and add.
- Where it appears in real life:
  - Ionic crystals are like repeating Lego blocks. The smallest neutral block (the “recipe” you just built) repeats in all directions. Its weight is just the sum of the pieces in that one block—exactly what you did here.

## Thinking setup: What are we really “weighing” here?
- Imagine a Lego model. The instruction sheet tells you how many of each brick you need. The weight of the model = sum of (number of each brick × weight of that brick).
- A chemical formula is the “instruction sheet.” For ionic compounds like aluminium sulphate, we don’t have molecules; we have a repeating ratio called a formula unit. So “formula unit mass” = sum of atomic masses, counting how many of each atom the formula says.

## Step-by-step from first principles
1) Identify the formula: aluminium sulphate = Al2(SO4)3.
   - This means: 2 aluminium atoms, 3 sulfate groups.
   - Each sulfate group SO4 has 1 sulfur and 4 oxygens.

2) Count atoms:
   - Al: 2
   - S: 3 × 1 = 3
   - O: 3 × 4 = 12

3) Multiply by atomic masses (u):
   - Al: 2 × 27 = 54 u
   - S: 3 × 32 = 96 u
   - O: 12 × 16 = 192 u

4) Add them up:
   - Total = 54 + 96 + 192 = 342 u

Answer: 342 u

## Why this makes sense (quick intuition)
- Mass adds. Parentheses mean “multiply everything inside by the outside number.” That’s why SO4 becomes 3 S and 12 O.
- Units check: we’re using atomic mass units (u), so the final is in u. If you switch to per-mole thinking, the same number becomes 342 g/mol.

## Quick exam tips
- For ionic compounds, say “formula unit mass” (not molecular mass), but calculate the same way.
- Always distribute the multiplier on parentheses: (SO4)3 means S × 3 and O × 12.
- Double-check you didn’t miss atoms inside parentheses.

## Conceptual follow-ups
- What if it’s hydrated? Example: Al2(SO4)3·18H2O adds 18 waters. Extra mass = 18 × (2×1 + 16) = 18 × 18 = 324 u. New total = 342 + 324 = 666 u.
- Why does the number in u match the number in g/mol? Because 1 mole contains Avogadro’s number of units, and 1 u per particle corresponds to 1 g per mole.

## Misconception clinic
- Many students forget to multiply the oxygen: They do O = 4×16 instead of 12×16. Fix: First expand (SO4)3 to S3O12.
- A common mistake is mixing units: writing “342 g.” It should be 342 u for one formula unit, or 342 g/mol for one mole.
- Some think ionic compounds have “molecules.” They don’t; they have a repeating lattice with a simplest ratio called the formula unit.

## Practice questions (fast mental checks)
1) Sodium sulfate, Na2SO4: 2×23 + 32 + 4×16 = 46 + 32 + 64 = 142 u.
2) Ammonium sulfate, (NH4)2SO4: N:2×14=28, H:2×4×1=8, S:32, O:4×16=64; total = 28+8+32+64=132 u.
3) Aluminium nitrate, Al(NO3)3: Al:27, N:3×14=42, O:9×16=144; total = 27+42+144=213 u.

## Reflective essence
- Chemistry formulas are compact “recipes.” If you can read the recipe, mass follows by pure counting and adding. Counting correctly is half the battle; the rest is careful unit thinking.
