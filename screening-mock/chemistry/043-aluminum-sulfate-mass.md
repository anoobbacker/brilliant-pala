# Question
Formula unit mass is calculated the same way as molecular mass is calculated. The formula unit mass of aluminium sulphate is  .......... u. (Given: Atomic mass of H = 1u, N = 14u, O = 16u, S = 32u, Al = 27u, Na = 23u)

# Answer

## Thinking setup: What are we really “weighing” here?
- Imagine a Lego model. The instruction sheet tells you how many of each brick you need. The weight of the model = sum of (number of each brick × weight of that brick).
- A chemical formula is the “instruction sheet.” For ionic compounds like aluminium sulphate, we don’t have molecules; we have a repeating ratio called a formula unit. So “formula unit mass” = sum of atomic masses, counting how many of each atom the formula says.

## Step-by-step from first principles
1) Identify the formula: aluminium sulphate = Al2(SO4)3.
   - This means: 2 aluminium atoms, 3 sulfate groups.
   - Each sulfate group SO4 has 1 sulfur and 4 oxygens.

2) Count atoms:
   - Al: 2
   - S: 3 × 1 = 3
   - O: 3 × 4 = 12

3) Multiply by atomic masses (u):
   - Al: 2 × 27 = 54 u
   - S: 3 × 32 = 96 u
   - O: 12 × 16 = 192 u

4) Add them up:
   - Total = 54 + 96 + 192 = 342 u

Answer: 342 u

## Why this makes sense (quick intuition)
- Mass adds. Parentheses mean “multiply everything inside by the outside number.” That’s why SO4 becomes 3 S and 12 O.
- Units check: we’re using atomic mass units (u), so the final is in u. If you switch to per-mole thinking, the same number becomes 342 g/mol.

## Quick exam tips
- For ionic compounds, say “formula unit mass” (not molecular mass), but calculate the same way.
- Always distribute the multiplier on parentheses: (SO4)3 means S × 3 and O × 12.
- Double-check you didn’t miss atoms inside parentheses.

## Conceptual follow-ups
- What if it’s hydrated? Example: Al2(SO4)3·18H2O adds 18 waters. Extra mass = 18 × (2×1 + 16) = 18 × 18 = 324 u. New total = 342 + 324 = 666 u.
- Why does the number in u match the number in g/mol? Because 1 mole contains Avogadro’s number of units, and 1 u per particle corresponds to 1 g per mole.

## Misconception clinic
- Many students forget to multiply the oxygen: They do O = 4×16 instead of 12×16. Fix: First expand (SO4)3 to S3O12.
- A common mistake is mixing units: writing “342 g.” It should be 342 u for one formula unit, or 342 g/mol for one mole.
- Some think ionic compounds have “molecules.” They don’t; they have a repeating lattice with a simplest ratio called the formula unit.

## Practice questions (fast mental checks)
1) Sodium sulfate, Na2SO4: 2×23 + 32 + 4×16 = 46 + 32 + 64 = 142 u.
2) Ammonium sulfate, (NH4)2SO4: N:2×14=28, H:2×4×1=8, S:32, O:4×16=64; total = 28+8+32+64=132 u.
3) Aluminium nitrate, Al(NO3)3: Al:27, N:3×14=42, O:9×16=144; total = 27+42+144=213 u.

## Reflective essence
- Chemistry formulas are compact “recipes.” If you can read the recipe, mass follows by pure counting and adding. Counting correctly is half the battle; the rest is careful unit thinking.
