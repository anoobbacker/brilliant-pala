# Question
How many of the following statement(s) is/are correct?
i) Sodium and potassium catch fire if kept in open. Hence to protect them and prevent accidental fires they are kept immersed in water  
ii) At ordinary temperature the surface of metals such as magnesium (Mg), aluminium (Al), zinc (Zn) and lead (Pb) are covered with a thin layer of oxide  
iii) Iron does not burn on heating  
iv) Copper burns vigorously on heating  
v) Silver and copper do not react with oxygen even at high temperature

# Answer

## Why do some metals catch fire while others just sit there?

Think of oxygen in air as a “greedy taker” of electrons. Metals are “givers.” When a metal gives electrons to oxygen, energy is released as heat. If that heat can’t escape fast enough, you see glowing or even fire. Whether a metal burns or just gets a thin skin (oxide layer) depends on:
- How eager its electrons are to leave (reactivity).
- How good the oxide layer is at sealing the surface (protective “skin”).
- Surface area (iron powder vs an iron nail).
- Temperature (heat helps reactions overcome the start-up barrier).

## Evaluate each statement

### i) Sodium and potassium catch fire if kept in open. Hence … they are kept immersed in water.
- Verdict: Incorrect.
- Why: Sodium and potassium are extremely reactive; they can catch fire in moist air. But they react violently with water:
  2Na + 2H₂O → 2NaOH + H₂(g) + heat
  The hydrogen plus heat can ignite. So we store them under kerosene oil, not water.

### ii) At ordinary temperature Mg, Al, Zn and Pb are covered with a thin layer of oxide.
- Verdict: Correct.
- Why: These metals quickly form a tightly stuck oxide “skin” (passivation) that slows further reaction:
  - Al → Al₂O₃ (very protective)
  - Zn → ZnO
  - Pb → PbO
  - Mg → MgO (protective at room temperature)

Think of it like a self-healing transparent jacket that blocks oxygen from getting to the metal underneath.

### iii) Iron does not burn on heating.
- Verdict: Correct (in the usual school context).
- Why: A lump of iron gets red hot and forms a scale of iron oxide, but does not burst into flame. However, iron filings or steel wool (huge surface area) do burn with sparks.

Surface area decides how fast heat is generated and lost — filings trap the heat and burn; a block loses heat too quickly to catch fire.

### iv) Copper burns vigorously on heating.
- Verdict: Incorrect.
- Why: Copper does not burn vigorously. On strong heating in air, it forms a black coating of copper(II) oxide (CuO), but no flame.

### v) Silver and copper do not react with oxygen even at high temperature.
- Verdict: Incorrect.
- Why: Silver is very unreactive to oxygen (no significant oxide even at high temperature in air), but copper does react and forms CuO on heating. So grouping copper with silver is wrong.

## How to think about it (first principles)

- Oxygen wants electrons; reactive metals give them easily.
- If the oxide that forms is dense and sticks well, it “passivates” the metal, slowing further reaction (Al, Zn, Pb).
- If the oxide is loose/flaky, oxygen can keep attacking (iron rusts).
- More surface area → more reaction sites → more heat per gram → easier to burn (iron filings vs iron nail).

A simple mental model:
- Metal core → Oxide skin → Air
- Good skin (Al₂O₃): blocks oxygen diffusion.
- Poor skin (rust): cracks, flakes, lets oxygen and water in.

## Experimental view (what you’d see in a lab)
- Heat Mg ribbon: it burns with a bright white flame, forming white MgO powder.
- Heat an iron nail: glows red, gets a black/grey scale; doesn’t flame. Heat steel wool: bright sparks.
- Heat copper wire: turns black (CuO forms); no vigorous burning.
- Expose Na/K to air/water: violent reaction; hence they’re stored in kerosene.

> ### 🧠 Quick Exam Tips
> - Store Na and K under kerosene, never water.
> - Al, Zn, Pb have protective oxide layers; “passivation” explains their slow corrosion.
> - Iron: filings burn; lump doesn’t. Surface area matters.
> - Copper heats to black CuO; silver stays mostly unreactive to oxygen.

## Misconception clinic
- Many students think “shiny = burns easily.” But copper and silver are shiny yet don’t burn; reactivity, not shininess, controls burning.
- A common mistake is assuming “if a metal reacts with oxygen, it must flame.” Oxidation can be slow and flameless, like copper turning black.
- “All metals react more at high temperature” is true, but protective oxides can still prevent visible burning (Al stays safe due to Al₂O₃ skin).

---

## Conceptual follow-ups
- What if you powder aluminum? Aluminum powder burns readily (think fireworks) because you defeat the protective skin with huge surface area.
- Why does galvanizing (coating iron with Zn) prevent rust? Zn forms a protective oxide and also sacrificially corrodes first.

> “Reflective essence”
> Chemistry often balances desire and defense: reactive metals “desire” to give electrons to oxygen, but some quickly build a defensive oxide shield. Understanding both the push (reactivity) and the shield (passivation) lets you predict who burns, who tarnishes, and who resists.
