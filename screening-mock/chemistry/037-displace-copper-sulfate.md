# Answer

## Quick visual reasoning
- Picture the blue copper sulfate as copper holding hands with sulfate. A newcomer can “cut in” only if it’s more pushy than copper. Then copper gets kicked out and coats the newcomer as a reddish skin.

- Magnesium: lights easily, even burns bright. Super pushy. Cuts in fast. Yes.
- Gold: jewelry stays shiny for years; it avoids reactions. Won’t cut in. No.
- Iron: rusts readily; class demo shows an iron nail turns copper-colored in blue solution. Cuts in. Yes.
- Hydrogen gas: bubbles don’t grab hands easily; without a special surface, they just float away. Doesn’t cut in. No.
- Mercury: shiny, reluctant, liquid; behaves like a noble metal. Doesn’t cut in. No.
- Lead: goes dull quickly, forms crusts; more willing than copper at first, so it can start the cut-in (then may slow as a crust forms). Yes.
- Silver: jewelry metal; barely reacts. Won’t cut in. No.
- Zinc: used to protect iron by sacrificing itself; very willing. Cuts in. Yes.

Count the “Yes”: Mg, Fe, Pb, Zn → 4.

Answer: 4 (Mg, Fe, Pb, Zn)

## Create twists
- Trap: “Hydrogen is reactive, so it should work.” Gas bubbles can’t easily hand over electrons into solution without a catalyst; no plating shows up.
- Trap: “Shiny means reactive.” Gold, silver, mercury stay shiny because they’re unreactive; lead looks dull yet can still push copper out at first.
- Trap: “Lead seems slow, so it can’t.” It can start the swap, then a crust can halt it. The question is “can,” not “how fast.”

- Same idea, different look: A zinc strip in blue copper solution turns copper-colored while the blue fades—zinc steals sulfate, copper gets dumped.
- In nature/engineering: Galvanized steel (zinc-coated) protects iron because zinc is more willing to react. Copper pipes last because few common metals around them can push copper out of its compounds.

## Big idea (everyday hook)
Imagine a “tug-of-war” for the sulfate partner in copper sulfate solution. The sulfate (SO4) is holding hands with Cu2+. A new metal M jumps in and says, “I can give away my electrons more easily than copper—let me take your place!” If M really is more eager to give electrons (more reactive), it will push copper out and take the sulfate partner.

That “push copper out” is what we call displacement.

## What is happening in solution (built from first principles)
- In water, copper(II) sulfate splits into ions: Cu2+ and SO4^2−.
- A solid metal M can try to donate electrons to Cu2+. If it does:
  - M gets oxidized (loses electrons): M → M^2+ + 2e−
  - Cu2+ gets reduced (gains electrons): Cu2+ + 2e− → Cu(s)
- Overall reaction:

```math
  \text{M (s)} + \text{CuSO}_4 \text{(aq)} \rightarrow \text{MSO}_4 \text{(aq)} + \text{Cu (s)}
  ```
- This only happens if M is “more willing” to lose electrons than copper—i.e., M is above copper in the reactivity series.

Plain-language rule:
- A metal above copper in the reactivity series will displace copper from CuSO4(aq).

Near copper, the useful order is:
```text
Mg > Zn > Fe > Pb > (H) > Cu > Hg > Ag > Au
```

## Test each candidate

We check if each is above Cu in the reactivity series:

- i) Magnesium (Mg): Above Cu → Yes
- ii) Gold (Au): Below Cu → No
- iii) Iron (Fe): Above Cu → Yes
- iv) Hydrogen gas (H2): Not a metal; in plain CuSO4(aq) it does not displace copper → No
  - Note: In acidic solution with a catalyst, H2 can reduce Cu2+, but that’s not this setup.
- v) Mercury (Hg): Below Cu → No
- vi) Lead (Pb): Above Cu → Yes
  - Note: Forms insoluble PbSO4 on the surface, which soon slows/stops further reaction, but displacement does occur.
- vii) Silver (Ag): Below Cu → No
- viii) Zinc (Zn): Above Cu → Yes

So the ones that displace copper are: Mg, Fe, Pb, Zn.

```math
\text{Count} = 4
```

Answer: 4

## Analytical view (why above/below matters)
Think in terms of “electron push.” A metal that more readily gives electrons will oxidize itself and reduce Cu2+ to Cu. That’s exactly what “above copper” in the series means: stronger electron donor than copper, so it can kick copper out.

---

## Experimental view (what you’d see)
- Drop strips of Mg, Zn, Fe, or Pb into blue CuSO4(aq):
  - The blue fades as Cu2+ is used up.
  - A reddish-brown coating of copper metal forms on the strip.
  - With Pb, a white PbSO4 crust may form, hindering further reaction.
- With Au, Ag, Hg, or H2:
  - No visible change (no copper deposit; solution stays blue).

---

## Intuitive checks
- Double the reactivity (e.g., use Mg instead of Zn): reaction is faster and more vigorous.
- Replace CuSO4 with another Cu2+ salt (like Cu(NO3)2): same displacement logic—only the spectator ion changes.
- Add acid plus a catalyst (like Pt) and use H2: now H2 can reduce Cu2+—but that’s a different setup.

## Misconception clinic
- “Hydrogen is above copper, so H2 will displace Cu.”  
  Not in this context. The “above hydrogen” rule tells you which metals liberate hydrogen from acids. Hydrogen gas itself doesn’t kick metals out of their aqueous salts without special conditions (acid + catalyst).
- “Lead won’t displace copper because it’s not very reactive.”  
  Lead is still above copper; it does displace Cu. The trick is PbSO4 crust can make it look like it stops early—but displacement has occurred.
- “Silver is shiny, so it must be reactive.”  
  Shiny doesn’t mean reactive. Ag is quite unreactive (below Cu), so it won’t displace copper.

## Extension challenges
- Link to batteries: Displacement reactions are the chemical heartbeat of many metal–ion batteries—electron push from one metal reduces ions of another.
- Environmental tech: “Cementation” uses a more reactive metal (like Fe) to remove heavy metal ions from wastewater by plating them out as solids.

## Interactive practice
1) Which would displace copper faster: Zn or Fe? Why?  
2) Would aluminum displace copper from CuSO4? What might you observe initially and why?  
3) If you acidify CuSO4 and bubble H2 over a platinum catalyst, what happens and why?

Suggested answers:
1) Zn, because it’s above Fe in the reactivity series (stronger electron donor).  
2) Yes—Al is above Cu, but its oxide layer can initially prevent reaction until it’s removed/scratched.  
3) H2 can reduce Cu2+ to Cu (with Pt catalysis in acidic solution), forming Cu(s) and H+ remains in solution.

> “Deep pattern”
> Chemistry often reduces to: Who gives electrons more easily, and who wants them more? Once you see reactions as electron trades driven by relative “push,” you can predict outcomes without memorizing every case.
