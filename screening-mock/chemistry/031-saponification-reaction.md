# Question
On treating with aqueous sodium hydroxide which is an alkali, ester is converted into alcohol and sodium salt of carboxylic acid. This reaction is known as  
   1) Esterification  
   2) Saponification  
   3) Neutralisation  
   4) Dehydration

# Answer

## Think from real life first:
- Traditional soap is made by boiling fats or oils with lye (sodium hydroxide). Fats and many oils are esters. Lye is a strong alkali (NaOH). The reaction breaks the ester into:
  - an alcohol (from the “alcohol part” of the ester), and
  - the sodium salt of a carboxylic acid (this salt is the soap).
- That process is called saponification (literally “soap-making”).

## Why it happens (simple cause-effect):
- In an ester, the carbonyl carbon (C=O) is slightly positive. The hydroxide ion (OH−) from NaOH is strongly attracted to it and attacks it.
- The molecule rearranges and splits, giving an alcohol and a carboxylate ion.
- The carboxylate pairs with Na+ to form the sodium salt. This salt is very stable in base, which makes the reaction effectively one-way.

Answer: 2) Saponification

## Tiny example:
- Ethyl ethanoate + NaOH → ethanol + sodium ethanoate
- Written simply: CH3COOCH2CH3 + NaOH → CH3COONa + CH3CH2OH

## Why the other options are wrong:
- Esterification: the reverse direction (alcohol + acid → ester + water, usually with acid catalyst), not with NaOH.
- Neutralisation: acid + base → salt + water. An ester is not an acid.
- Dehydration: removal of water from a molecule. Here, water isn’t being eliminated; the ester is being hydrolyzed by base.

## Quick exam tips:
- Base hydrolysis of an ester = saponification = alcohol + sodium carboxylate.
- Acid hydrolysis of an ester gives alcohol + carboxylic acid (and is reversible).
- The “one-way” push in base comes from forming the stable carboxylate salt. 

## Practice check:
- What are the products when methyl benzoate reacts with aqueous NaOH? Answer: methanol + sodium benzoate.
