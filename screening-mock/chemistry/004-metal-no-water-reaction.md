   D) K

# Answer
## Quick visual reasoning
- Picture a clear bowl of water. Drop each metal in your mind:
- Sodium: a soft silvery blob skates, hisses, and may flame on the surface — very reactive.
- Potassium: does the same, even wilder — clearly reacts.
- Calcium: a small bit sinks and slowly releases tiny bubbles; water turns slightly cloudy over time — slow reaction.
- Nickel: think of a coin sitting in a glass of water for days — no bubbles, no cloudiness, no change.

Therefore, the one that does not react with water is C) Ni.

## Create twists
- Typical trap: “All metals react with water.” Quick check: coins in fountains don’t fizz — many don’t react.
- Typical trap: Mixing up slow with none. Calcium’s faint bubbles and cloudiness show it’s reacting, just gently.
- Same idea, different look: Choosing materials for pipes or tanks? Favor coin-like, hard, shiny metals (nickel/stainless) that sit quietly in water.
- Nature/engineering check: Sodium/potassium must be stored under oil because water sets them off; nickel-containing alloys are used where water contact is constant, proving water leaves nickel alone.

## Why? Think like this:
- What does “react with water” mean? The metal gives electrons to water molecules, making hydrogen gas bubble out and forming a metal hydroxide in the water.
- If a metal gives away its outer electrons easily, it reacts quickly with water. If it holds them tightly or forms a protective surface, it won’t.

Check each option:
- K (potassium): Very reactive with cold water. Violent fizzing. Reaction: 2K + 2H2O → 2KOH + H2
- Na (sodium): Also very reactive with cold water. 2Na + 2H2O → 2NaOH + H2
- Ca (calcium): Reacts with cold water, but more slowly. Milky solution forms (slightly soluble Ca(OH)2). Ca + 2H2O → Ca(OH)2 + H2
- Ni (nickel): Does not react with cold water. It’s a transition metal with a tougher surface that resists this reaction.

So, the only metal here that does NOT react with water (at room temperature) is nickel.

## Deeper understanding (for exam speed):
- Pattern recognition:
  - Group 1 (alkali metals: K, Na) → react vigorously with cold water.
  - Group 2 lower members (like Ca) → react with cold water but less violently.
  - Many transition metals (like Ni, Cu) → do not react with cold water; some only react with steam or not at all.

- Cause-effect chain:
  - Down a group (like K below Na), the outer electron is farther from the nucleus → easier to lose → faster reaction with water.
  - Transition metals often form protective oxide layers and don’t give electrons as readily to water at room temperature.

Quick experiments you could imagine:
- Drop a small piece of sodium in water → darting, fizzing, heat, hydrogen gas.
- Drop calcium in water → slower fizzing, milky solution (calcium hydroxide).
- Drop nickel in water → nothing noticeable.

Answer: C) Ni (nickel)

## Quick exam tips:
- “Alkali metals + cold water” = instant hydrogen + alkaline solution.
- Calcium does react with cold water. Don’t confuse it with magnesium. Mg reacts with steam, not much with cold water.
- Transition metals like Ni don’t react with cold water.

## Practice questions:
1) Which pair both react with cold water?
   a) K and Mg
   b) Ca and Na
   c) Ni and Cu
   d) Al and Zn
   Correct: b) Ca and Na

2) Write the balanced equation for calcium reacting with water.
   Answer: Ca + 2H2O → Ca(OH)2 + H2

3) True or False: Magnesium reacts vigorously with cold water.
   Answer: False (it reacts with steam, very slowly with cold water)

4) Why is sodium stored under oil?
   Answer: To keep air and moisture away, because it reacts rapidly with water in the air.

## Misconception clinic:
- Many students think “calcium doesn’t react with water.” Actually, it does (slowly), making Ca(OH)2 and H2.
- “All metals react with water.” Not true. Many transition metals (Ni, Cu) don’t react with cold water.
- “Reactivity only depends on the metal, not the form.” Surface matters: powders react faster than lumps because of larger surface area.

---

## What-if thought:
- If you go down Group 1 from Na to K, reaction with water gets more vigorous. Why? The outer electron is more weakly held, so it transfers to water more easily, boosting the reaction rate and heat released.

## Reflective essence:
- Nature’s pattern: Reactions happen when it’s easy for electrons to move. Structures and surfaces that hold or block electrons (like oxide films) can switch a reaction from violent to silent. Understanding the “electron story” makes reactivity trends feel obvious.
