# Answer

## Read the clue like a detective

Imagine dropping a small piece of aluminum foil into drain cleaner (which contains NaOH): it fizzes and releases a gas — hydrogen. The same foil also fizzes with dilute sulfuric acid. What kind of element behaves like this?

The question says:
- Element X reacts with dilute H2SO4 to give a salt and H2 gas.
- The same X reacts with NaOH to give a salt and H2 gas.

We must decide which statements about X and its oxide are true.

Options include:
I) X is electropositive
II) Oxide of X is basic
III) Oxide of X is acidic
IV) X is electronegative

Answer preview: 4) I, II, III

Let’s justify from first principles.

## Build from physical meaning

### Why does a metal bubble in acid?
Think: who wants electrons more, acid or metal?

- Acids contain H+ (protons) which are “electron-hungry.”
- Many metals have loosely held outer electrons — they’re ready donors.

Cause-effect chain:
- Metal donates electrons → H+ gains electrons → H atoms pair up → H2 gas forms.

Symbolically:
```math
\text{M} \to \text{M}^{n+} + n e^-
```
```math
2\text{H}^+ + 2e^- \to \text{H}_2
```
Net (example with Zn in H2SO4):
```math
\text{Zn} + \text{H}_2\text{SO}_4 \to \text{ZnSO}_4 + \text{H}_2
```
Conclusion: reacting with acid to release H2 means X is electropositive (a metal-like electron donor). So I is true, IV is false.

### Why would a metal bubble in base (NaOH)?
At first this feels odd: a base doesn’t have free H+. Where does H2 come from?

- The hydrogen comes from water molecules, not from OH− directly.
- Only certain metals (like Al, Zn, Sn, Pb) can dissolve in strong base and still donate electrons; they form complex “oxo-hydroxide” anions.

Example with aluminum:
```math
2\text{Al} + 2\text{NaOH} + 6\text{H}_2\text{O} \to 2\text{Na[Al(OH)}_4] + 3\text{H}_2
```
Example with zinc:
```math
\text{Zn} + 2\text{NaOH} + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} \to \text{Na}_2[\text{Zn(OH)}_4] + \text{H}_2
```
So X must be an amphoteric metal (one that reacts with both acids and bases). Classic examples: Al, Zn, Sn, Pb.

## What does that say about the oxide of X?

Amphoteric metals form amphoteric oxides: the oxide reacts with both acids and bases.

Example with Al2O3:
```math
\text{Al}_2\text{O}_3 + 6\text{HCl} \to 2\text{AlCl}_3 + 3\text{H}_2\text{O}   \quad (\text{acts basic})
```
```math
\text{Al}_2\text{O}_3 + 2\text{NaOH} + 3\text{H}_2\text{O} \to 2\text{Na[Al(OH)}_4] \quad (\text{acts acidic})
```
So, describing the oxide as “basic” (II) and as “acidic” (III) are each incomplete alone, but together they capture amphoterism — it can behave as both. Hence II and III are jointly true.

## Final decision

- I) X is electropositive — True
- II) Oxide of X is basic — True (in reactions with acids)
- III) Oxide of X is acidic — True (in reactions with bases)
- IV) X is electronegative — False

Correct option: 4) I, II, III

## Analytical, intuitive, and experimental lenses

- Intuitive: If X gives H2 with acid, it must be giving electrons to H+. If it also gives H2 with base, it must also be able to dissolve in alkaline conditions — hallmark of amphoteric metals.
- Analytical: The redox half-reactions show electron donation by X in both cases; the base route uses water as the hydrogen source.
- Experimental: Put Zn or Al in dilute H2SO4 → brisk effervescence of H2. Put them in warm NaOH solution → bubbles of H2 and solution becomes colorless with formation of aluminate/zincate.

> - “Bubbles with both acid and base” screams amphoteric metal (think Al, Zn).
> - Amphoteric oxide = reacts with both acids and bases → both “basic” and “acidic” behavior.
> - Electropositive vs electronegative: metals donate electrons (electropositive), nonmetals attract (electronegative).

## Misconception Clinic

- Many students think “Bases can’t produce H2 because they don’t have H+.” But actually, water supplies hydrogen; the metal reduces water under strongly basic conditions.
- A common mistake is assuming “all metal oxides are basic.” Amphoteric oxides (Al2O3, ZnO, PbO, SnO) break that rule — they are both.
- Thinking “if it reacts with base, it must be nonmetal.” Not here: amphoteric metals react with base, but they’re still electropositive.

---

## Conceptual follow-ups

- What if an element reacts with acids to give H2, but not with bases? Its oxide is likely basic (typical of most metals like Mg, Fe).
- What if an element reacts with bases and not with acids? That suggests a nonmetal oxide (acidic oxide) — but nonmetals don’t typically give H2 with base.
- Periodic hint: Amphoterism often appears near the metal–nonmetal border (Al, Zn, Sn, Pb) — the “in-between” behavior.

3) If X only reacts with HCl to give H2 but not with NaOH, which statements are likely?

Answer: I and II.

> “Reflective essence”
> Nature loves duality: things near a boundary often show two faces. Amphoteric metals sit between typical metals and nonmetals — and their oxides reveal that “both-sides” personality by reacting with both acids and bases.
