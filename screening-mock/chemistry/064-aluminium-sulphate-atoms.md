# Question
How many atoms are there in the formula of Aluminium sulphate?

# Answer
Find how many atoms are present in the formula of aluminium sulphate, by building the formula from first principles and then counting carefully.
## Quick visual reasoning
- Imagine each aluminium atom has three “hooks,” and each sulphate group is a plate with two “sockets.”
- To clip everything with no loose ends, use the smallest set where hooks = sockets:
  - Two aluminium pieces give 6 hooks.
  - Three sulphate plates give 6 sockets. Click—everything locks.
- So one tidy packet is: 2 Al + 3 sulphate groups.
- Each sulphate group is a hub with 1 sulfur holding 4 oxygens.
  - From 3 groups: sulfur = 3 centers, oxygen = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 around them.
- Count atoms in the packet:
  - Aluminium: 2
  - Sulfur: 3
  - Oxygen: 12
  - Total: 2 + 3 + 12 = 17 atoms

Answer: 17 atoms in aluminium sulphate.

## Create twists
- Trap: Forgetting the “3” multiplies everything inside the sulphate group. Spot it by imagining three full SO4 clusters, not just tripling oxygen.
- Trap: Thinking sulfur is 4 because “SO4.” The 4 belongs to oxygen only; sulfur is the central hub—one per group.
- Same idea elsewhere: For calcium nitrate, picture calcium with two hooks and nitrate with one socket. You’d need two nitrate plates to use both hooks; then count centers and surrounding atoms.
- In nature/engineering: Like LEGO connectors—choose pieces so all studs meet all holes with none left over. The total atoms are just the studs-and-holes set you’ve clipped together.

## 1) Start from everyday intuition
- Think of atoms and ions like Lego blocks with hooks that must latch together so the final structure is “balanced.”
- Metals (like aluminium) tend to lose electrons (lose negative charge), becoming positively charged blocks.
- Nonmetals or groups containing oxygen (like sulphate) tend to gain electrons (gain negative charge), becoming negatively charged blocks.
- When we build an ionic compound, we choose counts of each ion so total positive and negative charges cancel to zero — like balancing a budget: total gains = total losses.

## 2) What charges do the building blocks carry?

### 2.1 Aluminium’s charge (why +3?)
- Aluminium’s atomic number is 13, so it has 13 electrons when neutral.
- Electron arrangement: 2, 8, 3. The outer (valence) shell has 3 electrons.
- Atoms prefer stable “full-shell” patterns. It’s easier for aluminium to lose 3 electrons (becoming 2, 8) than to gain 5.
- Losing 3 electrons gives the ion Al³⁺ (three positives because it has 3 more protons than remaining electrons).

So aluminium tends to form Al³⁺.

### 2.2 Sulphate’s charge (why −2?)
- The sulphate ion is a group of atoms that stays together as a unit: SO₄ with an overall negative charge.
- Oxygen typically has an oxidation state of −2 (it “wants” 2 electrons to fill its valence shell).
- Let sulphur’s oxidation state be x. The total for SO₄ must match the ion’s net charge (which we will deduce).
  
  We know oxygen is −2 and there are 4 oxygens:

```math
  x + 4(-2) = \text{charge of SO}_4
  ```
  If SO₄ were neutral, the left side would be x − 8. In actual chemistry, the sulphate ion carries an overall −2 charge (this is supported by acid chemistry: removing two H⁺ from H₂SO₄ leaves SO₄²⁻). So set the sum to −2:

```math
  x + 4(-2) = -2 \implies x - 8 = -2 \implies x = +6
  ```
- The key takeaway: the sulphate ion is SO₄²⁻.

So sulphate tends to be SO₄²⁻.

## 3) Build a neutral compound from Al³⁺ and SO₄²⁻
- We need to combine positive and negative charges so the total is zero.
- Use least common multiple reasoning with charges 3 and 2:
  - Two Al³⁺ ions give total +6.
  - Three SO₄²⁻ ions give total −6.
  - +6 and −6 cancel.

Check the neutrality:
```math
2(+3) + 3(-2) = +6 - 6 = 0
```

Therefore, the ratio is Al:SO₄ = 2:3, and the formula is:
```math
\text{Al}_2(\text{SO}_4)_3
```
- The parentheses mean “three copies of the entire SO₄ group.”

## 4) Count the atoms in Al₂(SO₄)₃
- Aluminium: 2 atoms (from Al₂).
- Sulphur: In each SO₄, there is 1 S. There are 3 SO₄ groups, so S = 3 × 1 = 3.
- Oxygen: In each SO₄, there are 4 O. With 3 groups, O = 3 × 4 = 12.

Total atoms:
```math
\text{Total} = 2\ (\text{Al}) + 3\ (\text{S}) + 12\ (\text{O}) = 17
```

Answer: 17 atoms in one formula unit of aluminium sulphate.

Note: Ionic solids don’t form discrete “molecules” like gases do; instead, we talk about a “formula unit,” the simplest whole-number ratio. The question’s “formula” refers to that unit.

## 5) Cross-check via reaction logic (experimental intuition)
If aluminium sulphate comes from neutralizing sulphuric acid with an aluminium base:
- Each Al³⁺ needs 3 OH⁻ to become Al(OH)₃.
- Each H₂SO₄ provides SO₄²⁻ after giving up 2 H⁺.
- Balancing gives ratios consistent with Al₂(SO₄)₃, confirming the 2:3 ion count:

```math
  2\ \text{Al(OH)}_3 + 3\ \text{H}_2\text{SO}_4 \rightarrow \text{Al}_2(\text{SO}_4)_3 + 6\ \text{H}_2\text{O}
  ```
This supports the same counting for the formula unit.

- 2 Al
- 3 S
- 12 O
- Total = 17

## Conceptual follow-up questions
1. Why does Al form Al³⁺ instead of Al¹⁺? Use electron arrangement to justify.
2. If oxide is O²⁻ and nitrate is NO₃⁻, explain why magnesium nitrate is Mg(NO₃)₂, not MgNO₃.
3. For Fe₂(SO₄)₃, how many atoms are in one formula unit? (Count Fe, S, O.)
4. If a compound is Ca₃(PO₄)₂, what charges must Ca and PO₄ have? Show the balancing logic.

## Application questions
- Water treatment uses “alum” (often Al₂(SO₄)₃·18H₂O) to coagulate impurities. How would the 18 water molecules change the total atom count per formula unit?
- In fertilizer chemistry, why does knowing the charge on phosphate (PO₄³⁻) matter when designing compounds like ammonium phosphate?

## Common misconceptions and reasoning traps
- “The 3 only multiplies the O, not the S in (SO₄)₃.” Incorrect. Parentheses apply to the entire group: both S and O are multiplied by 3.
- “SO₄ means 4 sulphur atoms.” No. The subscript applies only to the element immediately before it. SO₄ has 1 S and 4 O.
- “Ionic compounds are molecules.” Not quite; they form extended lattices. We count atoms per formula unit, not per free molecule.
- “Crossing charges is a trick.” It’s really just the least common multiple idea: choose counts so total positive and negative charges cancel.

## Extension challenges
1. Count atoms in Al₂(SO₄)₃·18H₂O.
   - Hint: Add atoms from 18 H₂O molecules to the 17 from Al₂(SO₄)₃.
2. Derive the formula and atom count for aluminium phosphate, given Al³⁺ and PO₄³⁻.
3. A compound contains 15.8% Al, 28.1% S, and 56.1% O by mass. Use empirical formula reasoning to check if it matches Al₂(SO₄)₃.
4. For potassium alum KAl(SO₄)₂·12H₂O, count the total atoms and explain the role of parentheses and the dot.

## Reflective insight
At the heart of formula writing is balance: nature prefers electrically neutral combinations. Charges arise from how easily atoms gain or lose electrons to achieve stable outer shells. Once you understand each ion’s charge and treat polyatomic ions as intact “bundles,” building the correct formula becomes a simple neutrality puzzle. Counting atoms is then just careful multiplication — a precise language that links microscopic structure to macroscopic properties.
