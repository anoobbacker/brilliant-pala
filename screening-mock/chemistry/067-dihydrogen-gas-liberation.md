# Answer
## Quick visual reasoning
- Imagine dropping each metal into a beaker of dilute hydrochloric acid and just watching: if you see fizzing (tiny bubbles), that’s hydrogen being pushed out by the metal.
- Which metals are “pushy” enough to shove hydrogen away from the acid?
  - Sodium, Potassium: they’re so eager they fizz violently even with water, so with acid they’ll certainly make lots of bubbles.
  - Magnesium: known to be lively; in acid it fizzes clearly.
  - Iron: not flashy with water, but acids clean iron by visible fizzing—so yes.
  - Lead: starts to fizz, then quickly grows a thin, whitish crust that chokes the reaction; but the initial bubbles mean it does liberate hydrogen.
- Which ones stay calm (no bubbles)?
  - Copper, Silver, Gold: used for coins/jewelry because they don’t get eaten by mild acids—no fizz.
  - Mercury: sits as a shiny liquid and needs a stronger, “biting” acid to react—no fizz with dilute hydrochloric acid.

So the ones that do liberate hydrogen: Pb, Fe, Mg, Na, K → total 5.

## Create twists
- Visual traps:
  - “Lead looks coated, so it must not react.” Spot the initial fizz before the crust forms—brief bubbles still count.
  - “Copper is a metal, acids dissolve metals.” Watch: copper sits there in dilute hydrochloric acid—no bubbles. Coins don’t fizz in mild acid.
- Same idea, different look:
  - If a metal fizzes with cold water (like Na, K), it will certainly fizz with dilute acid.
  - If a metal is used for jewelry or coins (Cu, Ag, Au), expect no fizz in dilute acid.
- Nature/engineering echoes:
  - Descaling iron with acid produces tiny bubbles—hydrogen—proving iron pushes hydrogen out of acids.
  - Lead pipes can resist by forming a protective crust; scratch it and you may see a brief return of fizz, showing the underlying tendency.

## Big Idea (start from what you’ve seen)
- When some metals touch dilute acid, we see bubbles. Those bubbles are hydrogen gas, H2.
- But not every metal bubbles. Gold jewelry doesn’t. Iron nails do. Why?

Think of it like a contest for electrons:
- Metal atoms “like” to lose electrons and become ions (that’s why they conduct and corrode).
- Hydrogen ions, H+, in acid “want” to gain electrons and pair up to make H2 gas.
- If the metal gives up electrons more eagerly than hydrogen takes them, hydrogen wins the electrons → H2 gas forms.

So the question becomes: For each metal, is it willing to give electrons to H+ under normal conditions (298 K) in dilute HCl?

We’ll reason this from first principles using electron-flow competition, not memorized lists.

## Step-by-step reasoning (from first principles)

### 1) What reaction are we testing?
For a metal M reacting with acid:
```math
\text{Oxidation (metal): } M \rightarrow M^{2+} + 2e^-
\text{  (typical case)}
```
```math
\text{Reduction (acid): } 2H^+ + 2e^- \rightarrow H_2(g)
```
Add them:
```math
M + 2H^+ \rightarrow M^{2+} + H_2(g)
```
In HCl, chloride just balances charge or forms the salt:
```math
M + 2HCl \rightarrow MCl_2 + H_2(g)
```
So: bubbles appear only if electrons actually flow from M to H+.

### 2) How do we decide if electrons will flow?
Physical picture:
- Think of each half-reaction like a tank of “electron pressure.”
- The hydrogen half (2H+/H2) is our reference “pressure” (set to 0 by convention).
- If the metal’s electron pressure is higher (it more strongly “pushes out” electrons), electrons flow from metal to H+, and H2 forms.

Chemistry wording:
- This “push” is measured by standard reduction potentials E° (experimentally measured at 298 K).
- Hydrogen is defined as 0. If E°(M2+/M) is negative, the metal is a strong electron giver versus H+ → reaction goes.
- The overall reaction’s driving force (E°reaction) is:
```math
E^\circ_{\text{reaction}} = E^\circ(\text{H}^+/\text{H}_2) - E^\circ(M^{2+}/M) = 0 - E^\circ(M^{2+}/M)
```
- If this is positive, H2 evolves spontaneously (thermodynamically favorable).

We don’t need exact numbers to judge most cases, because everyday reactivity gives clues:
- Very reactive metals (K, Na, Mg, Fe) easily lose electrons → likely to make H2.
- Noble metals (Cu, Ag, Hg, Au) hold electrons tightly → unlikely to make H2.

### 3) A complication: coatings that stop the reaction (kinetics vs thermodynamics)
Even if the reaction is thermodynamically allowed, it might be blocked by a coating that forms on the metal surface.
- Example: Lead + HCl forms PbCl2, which is poorly soluble at room temperature. It makes a tight, insoluble layer (“passivation”) that stops further reaction, so you don’t see ongoing bubbling at 298 K in dilute HCl.
- This is a kinetic barrier: the reaction “wants” to go, but gets physically blocked.

At higher temperature (PbCl2 becomes more soluble) or without this coating, bubbling could resume.

## Decision for each metal (at ## Decision for each metal (at 298 K, dilute HCl)
We decide by two linked ideas:
- Thermodynamics (will electron flow be favorable?): metals that more readily lose electrons than hydrogen will reduce H+ to H2.
- Kinetics/surface effects (can electrons actually flow?): coatings can block the reaction even if it’s favorable.

i) Lead (Pb)
- Thermodynamics: borderline favorable (lead is just above hydrogen in electron-giving tendency).
- Surface kinetics: forms an insoluble PbCl2 layer at room temperature that blocks the surface (passivation).
- Outcome at 298 K in dilute HCl: no sustained bubbling; effectively “does not liberate H2” under these conditions.

ii) Silver (Ag)
- Holds electrons too tightly compared to H+; H+ cannot oxidize Ag.
- No H2 is liberated.

iii) Gold (Au)
- Very “noble” (resists oxidation).
- No H2 is liberated.

iv) Iron (Fe)
- Readily gives electrons to H+.
- Clear, sustained bubbling; forms FeCl2.
- Yes, liberates H2.

v) Copper (Cu)
- Too unreactive toward H+ (below H in the electron-giving tendency).
- No H2 is liberated.

vi) Mercury (Hg)
- Also below hydrogen in this sense; H+ is not strong enough to oxidize Hg in dilute HCl.
- No H2 is liberated.

vii) Magnesium (Mg)
- Very ready electron donor; vigorous reaction.
- Yes, liberates H2.

viii) Sodium (Na)
- Extremely reactive; reacts violently with aqueous acid, liberating H2.
- Yes, liberates H2 (dangerous; not a school experiment).

ix) Potassium (K)
- Even more reactive; violent reaction with aqueous acid, liberating H2 (often ignites).
- Yes, liberates H2 (do not attempt).

### Final count
- Metals that liberate H2 from dilute HCl at 298 K: Fe, Mg, Na, K → 4 metals.

Note on lead (Pb): You might see a trace of gas initially before the PbCl2 skin forms, but at 298 K in dilute HCl, the protective layer quickly stops the reaction. At higher temperature (where PbCl2 is more soluble) or if the layer is removed, Pb can evolve H2.

## Why this conclusion follows (two complementary lenses)

### A) Intuitive “electron competition” lens
- If a metal is eager to give electrons and H+ is ready to take them, H2 appears. That’s why reactive metals (K, Na, Mg, Fe) bubble in acid.
- Noble metals (Au, Ag, Hg, Cu) don’t hand over electrons to H+ under these mild conditions; they don’t bubble.

### B) Electrochemical lens (half-cells joined)
- Hydrogen reference: E°(2H+/H2) = 0 V by definition.
- If E°(M2+/M) is negative, then:
```math
E^\circ_{\text{reaction}} = 0 - E^\circ(M^{2+}/M) > 0
```
so the reaction M + 2H+ → M2+ + H2 is thermodynamically favorable.
- Typical trends (qualitative): K, Na, Mg, Fe have negative E°(M2+/M) → tend to react; Cu, Ag, Hg, Au have positive E° → don’t react.
- Special case Pb: slightly negative (so favorable), but kinetic passivation by PbCl2 stops it at 298 K in dilute HCl.

A neat twist: For Pb, the sparing solubility of PbCl2 makes [Pb2+] very small, which, by the Nernst equation, makes the metal even more reducing thermodynamically. Yet the solid film blocks electron flow physically—kinetics beats thermodynamics in practice.

## Quick balanced examples
- Iron:
```math
\text{Fe} + 2\text{HCl} \rightarrow \text{FeCl}_2 + \text{H}_2\uparrow
```
- Magnesium:
```math
\text{Mg} + 2\text{HCl} \rightarrow \text{MgCl}_2 + \text{H}_2\uparrow
```
- Sodium:
```math
2\text{Na} + 2\text{HCl} \rightarrow 2\text{NaCl} + \text{H}_2\uparrow
```
- Lead (why passivation matters):
```math
\text{Pb} + 2\text{HCl} \rightarrow \text{PbCl}_2(s)\,\text{(surface film)} + \text{H}_2
```
At 298 K in dilute HCl, the PbCl2(s) film stops further reaction.

## Multiple ways to be confident (analytical vs experimental)

- Analytical: Use electron-giving tendency (qualitative E° logic) and consider passivation layers.
- Experimental: Put small, safe samples in dilute HCl and observe bubbles (never try Na or K; even Mg can be vigorous). You will see Fe and Mg bubble; Cu, Ag, Au, Hg won’t; Pb won’t continue bubbling due to passivation at room temperature.

## Answers in one line per metal
- Pb: No (passivated by PbCl2 at 298 K).
- Ag: No.
- Au: No.
- Fe: Yes.
- Cu: No.
- Hg: No.
- Mg: Yes.
- Na: Yes (violent).
- K: Yes (very violent).

Count = 4.

## 1) Conceptual follow-up questions
- If you heat the HCl solution containing lead, what happens and why? Consider the solubility of PbCl2 and its effect on the passivation layer.
- Replace dilute HCl with dilute H2SO4. Which metals change behavior, and how does PbSO4’s solubility influence lead’s reaction?
- Replace dilute HCl with dilute HNO3 (an oxidizing acid). Would Cu now produce H2? If not, what gas or products appear and why?
- How would scratching or grinding a passivated lead surface change the immediate observation? For how long?
- If you connect an iron nail electrically to a copper strip in acid (making a tiny galvanic cell), which part dissolves faster? Why?

---

## 2) Real-life applications and links
- Pickling steel: Factories clean rust and scale using dilute acids. Why is iron cleaned effectively but copper plumbing isn’t attacked by dilute HCl?
- Sacrificial protection: Why does attaching zinc (more reactive) protect iron structures (ships, pipelines)?
- Batteries: How does a passivation layer (like PbSO4 in lead–acid batteries) control charge/discharge and limit performance?
- Hydrogen safety: Why are Na and K never used to generate H2 in labs, even though the chemistry works?
- Metallurgy and etching: Choosing acids that dissolve certain metals but not others is central to circuit fabrication and metal finishing.

## 3) Common misconceptions and reasoning traps
- “All acids react with all metals to give H2.” False. Only if the metal is a stronger electron donor than hydrogen and no blocking/passivating layer forms.
- “If a reaction is thermodynamically favorable, it will definitely happen fast.” False. Kinetics and surface films (PbCl2, Al2O3 on aluminum) can stop or slow it drastically.
- “Copper doesn’t react with acids at all.” It does react with oxidizing acids (e.g., HNO3), but not with non-oxidizing acids like dilute HCl to make H2.
- “Presence of chloride always helps dissolve metals.” Sometimes it causes passivation (PbCl2) that prevents further reaction.

How to avoid them: Always ask two questions—Is it thermodynamically favorable (electron competition)? Can it actually proceed (kinetics, passivation, mass transport)?

---

## 4) Extension challenges
- Using the Nernst idea qualitatively, explain why lowering the concentration of M2+ (by precipitating MCl2) increases the thermodynamic push for oxidation, yet the reaction may still stop.
- Design a safe comparative experiment (excluding Na/K) to rank Mg, Al (with oxide removed), Zn, Fe by their H2 evolution rates in dilute HCl.
- Consider sulfuric acid: Predict and justify the behavior of Pb with dilute vs concentrated H2SO4 (think PbSO4 solubility and oxidizing power).
- Suppose you add a chloride-complexing agent that dissolves PbCl2 films. Predict what happens to lead’s reaction with HCl at room temperature.
- Compute E°reaction for Fe + 2H+ → Fe2+ + H2, given E°(Fe2+/Fe) ≈ −0.44 V and E°(H+/H2) = 0 V. Explain the sign and its meaning for spontaneity.

## 5) Reflective insight (the essence)
At heart, this topic is not about memorizing a reactivity series. It’s about an electron tug-of-war and the environment that mediates it. Hydrogen ions will become H2 if the metal pushes electrons harder than hydrogen does, but surfaces decide whether that push can act. Thermodynamics tells you if nature “wants” the change; kinetics and interfaces decide if nature “can” do it now. When you always check both—driving force and pathway—you’ll navigate any unfamiliar case with confidence.

Final answer: 4 metals (Fe, Mg, Na, K) liberate dihydrogen gas from dilute HCl at 298 K.
