# Answer

## Quick visual reasoning
- i) “A compound breaks into its elements”  
  Picture a two-color Lego brick splitting into two single-color bricks. One thing becomes simpler pieces. That’s decomposition → q.

- ii) “A metal and a non‑metal react to form one ionic compound”  
  Imagine a plus-magnet and a minus-magnet snapping together into one block. Two separate pieces become one. That’s combination → p.

- iii) “A hydrogen–carbon compound reacts with oxygen to give carbon dioxide and water”  
  Think of a fuel flame: it gulps air, makes invisible gas and mist, releasing heat and light. Classic burning. That’s combustion → t.

- iv) “Silver ion meets bromide ion and a solid forms”  
  Two dancing pairs in solution swap partners; one new pair is so tightly bound it falls out as a cloudy solid. That’s double displacement → s.

So the matches are:
(i - q); (ii - p); (iii - t); (iv - s)

Correct option: 1

## Create twists
- Common trap: Calling (ii) displacement. Spot the difference: displacement is “one kicks another out.” Here no one gets kicked out; they simply join → combination.
- Common trap: Mixing up (iv) with single displacement. In single displacement, one element replaces another. Here, two ions swap partners and a solid appears → double displacement.
- Don’t confuse (i) with the reverse of (ii): direction matters. One thing splitting is decomposition; many becoming one is combination.
- Combustion clue: presence of oxygen, flame/heat, and products that are “invisible gas” plus “water.”

Use the same lens elsewhere:
- Seeing gas bubbles when heating a single solid → likely decomposition.
- Metal plus oxygen making an oxide layer → combination.
- Candle/petrol burning to foggy water on a cold surface and invisible gas → combustion.
- Mixing two clear salt solutions and getting milkiness/solid flakes → double displacement (precipitation), used in water treatment and lab tests.

## Match Reaction Types — think like patterns in everyday life

Start with a simple picture: chemistry is like LEGO for atoms. Sometimes a big model breaks into pieces (decomposition). Sometimes small pieces snap together to make a bigger model (combination). Sometimes two pairs swap partners (double displacement). And sometimes a fuel reacts with oxygen to release energy as flame (combustion).

## The Matches (Answer)

- i) A compound breaks apart into elements → q) Decomposition  
- ii) A metal and non-metal react to form an ionic compound → p) Combination  
- iii) A hydrocarbon reacts with oxygen to produce CO₂ and H₂O → t) Combustion  
- iv) Ag⁺ from AgNO₃ forms a precipitate with Br⁻ from KBr → s) Double displacement

So the correct option is:
1) (i - q); (ii - p); (iii - t); (iv - s)

## Why each match? From first principles

### i) Compound breaks into elements → Decomposition
- Everyday analogy: A cake being sliced into basic ingredients is impossible, but you can break a complex LEGO structure into separate blocks. In chemistry, a compound splitting into simpler substances is decomposition.
- Cause-effect: Energy input (heat, light, electricity) breaks bonds holding different elements together.

Example:
```math
2 \, \text{HgO} \xrightarrow{\text{heat}} 2 \, \text{Hg} + \text{O}_2
```

### ii) Metal + non-metal → Ionic compound → Combination
- Analogy: One piece from the left (metal) and one from the right (non-metal) join to make a single product.
- Cause-effect: Metals tend to lose electrons; non-metals tend to gain. Opposite charges attract → ions lock into a lattice.

Example:
```math
2 \, \text{Na} + \text{Cl}_2 \rightarrow 2 \, \text{NaCl}
```

### iii) Hydrocarbon + oxygen → CO₂ + H₂O → Combustion
- Analogy: Fuel plus oxygen in a car engine produces hot gases and water vapor—energy release is the point.
- Cause-effect: Carbon wants to become the most stable oxide (CO₂); hydrogen becomes H₂O. Both releases energy → flame/heat/light.

General pattern:
```math
\text{C}_x\text{H}_y + \left(x + \frac{y}{4}\right)\text{O}_2 \rightarrow x \, \text{CO}_2 + \frac{y}{2} \, \text{H}_2\text{O}
```

### iv) Ag⁺(aq) + Br⁻(aq) → AgBr(s) precipitate → Double displacement
- Analogy: Two dancing pairs swap partners; the new pair AgBr is so tightly bound it leaves the dance floor (falls out as a solid).
- Cause-effect: When the ions swap, one of the new pair is poorly soluble. Water can’t keep Ag⁺ and Br⁻ apart → they form a solid lattice.

Full and net ionic:
```math
\text{AgNO}_3(aq) + \text{KBr}(aq) \rightarrow \text{AgBr}(s) + \text{KNO}_3(aq)

\text{Net ionic: } \quad \text{Ag}^+(aq) + \text{Br}^-(aq) \rightarrow \text{AgBr}(s)
```

## Multiple Lenses

- Intuitive view:
  - Decomposition: one → many.
  - Combination: many → one.
  - Combustion: hydrocarbon + O₂ → flame + CO₂ + H₂O.
  - Double displacement: ions swap; look for a precipitate, gas, or weak electrolyte (like water) forming.

- Analytical view:
  - Check number of products/reactants:
    - One reactant splitting? Decomposition.
    - Two reactants into one product? Combination.
    - Hydrocarbon + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O? Combustion.
    - Two aqueous ionic solutions mixing with a solid forming? Double displacement.

- Experimental view:
  - Decomposition: needs energy input (heat, electrolysis); gas may evolve.
  - Combination: bright light/heat sometimes (e.g., Na + Cl₂).
  - Combustion: flame, heat, CO₂ test with limewater, H₂O as condensation.
  - Double displacement: immediate cloudiness/solid forms; filterable precipitate.

## Misconception Clinic

- Many students think any reaction that “forms a solid” is combination. Actually, if two aqueous salts mix and a solid appears, that’s usually double displacement (precipitation), not combination.
- A common mistake is calling “metal + non-metal → salt” a displacement. There’s no “kicking out” here—new ionic bonds form directly, so it’s combination.
- Students sometimes say combustion “needs flame.” The flame is an effect of rapid exothermic reaction; even slow oxidation (rusting) is related, but hydrocarbon combustion specifically gives CO₂ and H₂O.

---

## Conceptual Follow-ups

- What if the hydrocarbon has oxygen in it (like ethanol)? It still combusts to CO₂ and H₂O—just balance with the extra oxygen already present.
- What if no precipitate forms when mixing two salt solutions? Then no visible reaction; ions stay dissolved—still double displacement “attempted,” but no driving force.

## Extension to real life

- Combustion is the basis of engines, power plants, and rocket propulsion.
- Precipitation reactions are used in water treatment to remove unwanted ions by forming insoluble salts.

## Interactive Practice

1) Identify type: 2KClO₃(s) → 2KCl(s) + 3O₂(g)  
- Answer: Decomposition (heating chlorates release O₂).

2) Identify type: CaO(s) + CO₂(g) → CaCO₃(s)  
- Answer: Combination (one product).

3) Identify type and write net ionic: Mixing BaCl₂(aq) and Na₂SO₄(aq) gives a white solid.  
- Answer: Double displacement (precipitation). Net ionic:
```math
\text{Ba}^{2+}(aq) + \text{SO}_4^{2-}(aq) \rightarrow \text{BaSO}_4(s)
```

4) True/False: CH₄ + O₂ → CO + H₂O is complete combustion.  
- Answer: False. Complete combustion makes CO₂, not CO.
