## Question
Which of the following oxide is insoluble in water?

**Options:**

1. $\mathrm{Na}_2 \mathrm{O}$
2. CuO
3. $\mathrm{K}_2 \mathrm{O}$
4. CaO

## Core idea
Dissolving is a tug-of-war. A solid crystal holds its ions together; water tries to pull them apart and surround them. Whether an oxide “dissolves” in water depends on:
- How strongly the ions in the solid attract each other (lattice attraction).
- How strongly water can grab and stabilize the ions (hydration).
- Whether a chemical reaction with water makes new, more stable ions (for oxides, making hydroxide, OH−).

For many metal oxides, water doesn’t just “dissolve” them—it reacts with them. If that reaction releases enough energy and the products are stable and soluble, the oxide disappears into solution. If not, it stays as a solid: insoluble.

## Option-by-option reasoning

### What “soluble in water” really means
- If you drop an oxide into water and it disappears, two things could be happening:
  1) Physical dissolution: the solid breaks into its ions, which get surrounded by water molecules.
  2) Chemical reaction with water: oxide ions O2− pull H from water to become hydroxide, OH−, and the metal forms a hydroxide in solution.
- Practically, we see: does the solid remain or does it form a clear alkaline solution?

### Group 1 oxides: Na2O and K2O
- Sodium and potassium are very reactive metals; their oxides are highly basic.
- Oxide ion O2− is an extremely strong “proton grabber.” It reacts with water to make hydroxide:
  
```math
\mathrm{Na_2O + H_2O \rightarrow 2\,NaOH}
```

```math
\mathrm{K_2O + H_2O \rightarrow 2\,KOH}
```

- NaOH and KOH are both very soluble in water, so the oxide effectively disappears. The solution becomes strongly alkaline and conductive. Everyday links: caustic soda (NaOH), potash (KOH) make very alkaline solutions used in cleaning and soap making.

Conclusion: Na2O and K2O are not insoluble; they react to give soluble hydroxides.

### Calcium oxide, CaO (quicklime)
- CaO also reacts with water, releasing heat (the “slaking” of lime) and forming calcium hydroxide:
  
```math
\mathrm{CaO + H_2O \rightarrow Ca(OH)_2}
```

- Calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2, is only slightly soluble (it makes “limewater”), but crucial point: the oxide itself does not remain unchanged; it reacts. You can see the temperature rise and the solid turning into a softer, crumbly material (slaked lime), some of which dissolves to give a mildly cloudy solution that clears to a slightly soluble “limewater.”

Conclusion: CaO is not insoluble in the exam sense; it reacts with water (even if the product is only sparingly soluble).

### Copper(II) oxide, CuO
- CuO is a transition-metal oxide with much stronger bonding in its crystal than water can overcome. It does not react with water to form a soluble hydroxide; copper(II) hydroxide itself is insoluble.
- So with water alone, nothing really happens: the black CuO powder remains unchanged. To dissolve CuO, you typically need an acid:
  
```math
\mathrm{CuO + 2\,H^+ \rightarrow Cu^{2+} + H_2O}
```

- Why? In simple energetic terms: the crystal’s ion-ion attractions (and some covalent character) are too strong, and the would-be products in water (like Cu(OH)2) are not soluble; water can’t “pay” the energy cost to pull it apart.

Conclusion: CuO is insoluble in water.

## Final answer
2) CuO

## Why this pattern makes sense (first-principles intuition)
- Think of charges and sizes: stronger opposite charges and closer ions make crystals harder to pull apart. Roughly, attraction grows with ion charges and decreases with ion size.
- Group 1 oxides (Na2O, K2O) have 1+ cations and the oxide reacts strongly with water to make highly soluble hydroxides—reaction plus good solubility drives them into solution.
- CaO still reacts, but its hydroxide is only slightly soluble—so some cloudiness remains, yet the oxide is not “insoluble.”
- CuO has a 2+ cation with higher charge density and some covalent character, giving a robust crystal and an insoluble hydroxide—water alone can’t win the tug-of-war.

## Experimental vs theoretical checks
- Experimental: Put equal spatulas of each oxide in water, stir, feel temperature, test pH and conductivity.
  - Na2O, K2O: heat up, fully dissolve, very high pH, high conductivity.
  - CaO: heats up, forms slurry that partially dissolves, high pH, moderate conductivity (due to limited solubility).
  - CuO: no temperature change, remains black solid, pH near neutral, low conductivity.
- Theoretical: Compare lattice attraction vs hydration and whether a favorable chemical reaction produces soluble products.

```

```math
\mathrm{CaO + H_2O \rightarrow Ca(OH)_2\ (sparingly\ soluble)}
```

```math

```

## 1) Conceptual follow-up questions
- If MgO is put in water, what would you expect compared to CaO and why?
- Would Al2O3 dissolve in water? How does “amphoteric” behavior change its reactivity in acid vs base?
- How would heating the water affect the solubility or reaction rate for CaO and CuO?
- Predict the behavior of SiO2 in water. Why is glass (mostly SiO2) so water-resistant?

## 2) Application questions
- Why is CaO used to make mortar and cement? How does its reaction with water enable construction materials to set?
- Why are NaOH and KOH common in drain cleaners, but not Ca(OH)2 or CuO?
- Why is the insolubility of CuO useful in ceramics and catalysts where you don’t want the material to leach into water?

## 3) Common misconceptions and how to avoid them
- “If a solid doesn’t make a clear solution, it’s insoluble.” Reality: Some oxides react to form sparingly soluble products (CaO → Ca(OH)2). The oxide is not “insoluble” just because the solution stays cloudy.
- “All metal oxides dissolve in water.” Many do not; especially transition metal oxides like CuO are insoluble in water but dissolve in acids.
- “Reacting with water is the same as dissolving.” Reaction can drive dissolution, but dissolution can also be purely physical. Always ask: does it chemically change? Are the products soluble?

## 4) Extension challenges
- Design a simple lab to quantify how much Ca(OH)2 dissolves at room temperature: outline steps using filtration, massing, and titration with dilute HCl.
- Use conductivity measurements to distinguish between “highly soluble,” “sparingly soluble,” and “insoluble” oxides.
- Model the trend of oxide solubility across a period and down a group by discussing changes in ion size, charge, and bond character (ionic vs covalent).

## 5) Reflective insight
At its core, solubility is about competing attractions: the crystal’s hold on its ions versus water’s ability to pry them away—and whether a chemical reaction creates stable, soluble products. Group 1 oxides win the “reaction plus solubility” game, CaO reacts but its product barely dissolves, and CuO doesn’t react with water and stays put. When you see any new oxide, think: charges, sizes, bond character, and product solubility—those four ideas will let you predict its behavior confidently.
