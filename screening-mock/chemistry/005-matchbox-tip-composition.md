# Answer
## Quick visual reasoning
- Scraping a match needs a surface that sparks from rubbing. Think: a powder that “wakes up” with friction and catches easily.
- CaO and the two phosphates feel like chalk/ceramic or bone—hard, stable, they just make dust when scraped, not flames.
- A phosphorus–sulfur mix behaves like a ready-to-burst ember: tiny grains heat up fast under friction and ignite.
- Among the choices, only P4S3 fits that “scratch-and-spark” behavior.

Answer: A) P₄S₃ 

## Create twists
- Trap: Many remember “red phosphorus” for the box strip. If “red phosphorus” isn’t an option, pick the friction‑sensitive phosphorus compound (here, P4S3) rather than rock-like salts.
- Different-looking problem: “Which part lets safety matches light only on the box?” The strip contains a phosphorus material; the head holds oxidizer/fuel. Strike‑anywhere matches put the friction‑sensitive stuff in the tip instead.
- In the real world: Flint-and-steel works the same way—soft metal scrapes off hot sparks into a tinder that “wants to catch,” unlike chalky minerals that just powder.

## What lights a match, really?

Think about this: you can rub a match on your jeans all day and it probably won’t light. But swipe it on the rough strip of the matchbox and whoosh! Why does the box matter?

Because modern “safety matches” are designed so the dangerous chemicals are split into two places:
- On the match head: fuel and an oxidizer (things that want to burn but need a push).
- On the matchbox’s striking surface: a special trigger chemical that starts the reaction safely only when rubbed there.

## Intuition first: friction → heat → trigger → flame

- Rubbing the match on the box creates heat (friction).
- That heat activates a chemical on the box that’s eager to help start burning.
- Once a tiny reaction starts, it sets off the bigger reaction in the match head.

This separation is why it’s called a safety match.

## What’s actually on each part?

- Striking surface (on the box): mainly red phosphorus + powdered glass (makes it rough).
- Match head: oxidizer like potassium chlorate (KClO3), fuel like sulfur or antimony sulfide, plus binders and fillers.

Key role: The red phosphorus on the box changes form under friction/heat and helps ignite the head’s mixture.

## So which option is correct?

The question asks: “Striking tip of matchbox is made up of …”

Scientifically correct: the striking surface has red phosphorus. But “red phosphorus” is not among the options.

What’s in the options?
- A) P₄S₃ (phosphorus sesquisulfide) — used in “strike-anywhere” match heads, not on the box.
- B) CaO, C) MgPO₄, D) CaPO₄ — not the active striking-surface chemical in safety matches.

Exam-writer intent check: Many exams mistakenly expect A) P₄S₃ for questions about “match tips,” mixing up match head vs. box. If you must choose from these, the answer they likely want is:

Answer: A) P₄S₃

But remember: in real safety matches, the striking surface is red phosphorus, not P₄S₃.

---

## Why this design works (cause → effect chain)

- Friction on box → heats red phosphorus
- Red phosphorus partially converts/reacts → produces very reactive phosphorus that ignites
- That tiny ignition → triggers oxidizer + fuel in the match head → sustained flame

Energy logic: friction supplies activation energy; chemistry supplies the rest.

> - Strike-anywhere match head: phosphorus sesquisulfide (P₄S₃).
> - If “red phosphorus” isn’t an option and they ask about “striking tip,” many exams expect A) P₄S₃, even though that’s for the head, not the box.

## Misconception Clinic
- Many students think the match head contains all the phosphorus. In safety matches, the red phosphorus is on the box, not in the head.
- Another confusion: “white phosphorus” vs “red phosphorus.” Safety matches use red phosphorus (more stable and safer), not white phosphorus (highly reactive and dangerous).
- Thinking CaO or phosphates are used in the striker: they can be fillers in some compositions, but they’re not the key striking-surface chemical.

## Quick practice
1) Which component acts as the oxidizer in many match heads?
- A) KClO₃
- B) S
- C) Glass powder
- D) Paraffin
Answer: A) KClO₃

2) Why add glass powder to the striking surface?
- To increase friction (roughness) so it heats up more effectively on contact.

3) If a match lights on any rough surface (like a wall), it is likely a:
- Strike-anywhere match (contains P₄S₃ in the head).

> ### 🌱 Reflective Essence
> Safety is often about separation and control: by keeping the trigger chemical (red phosphorus) apart from the oxidizer and fuel, we make a dangerous reaction happen only where and when we want it to. Understanding “who’s where” is the key to both safety and ignition.
