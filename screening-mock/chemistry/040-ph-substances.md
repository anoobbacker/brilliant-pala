# Answer

## Quick visual reasoning
Think “pH ≥ 7” as “neutral or basic.” Use everyday feel: sour → acid; slippery/soapy/antacid → base; plain → neutral.

- Gastric juice: sharp, sour stomach acid → below neutral → no.
- Blood: body keeps it slightly on the basic side to safely cancel small acids → yes.
- Aqueous sodium hydroxide: classic slippery, drain-cleaner base → yes.
- Pure water: plain neutral → equals neutral → yes.
- Milk of magnesia: antacid that calms stomach acid → must be basic → yes.
- Lemon juice: sour citrus → acid → no.

Count with pH equal to or more than neutral: 4 (blood, NaOH solution, pure water, milk of magnesia).

## Create twists
- Visual traps:
  - “Milk of magnesia” isn’t milk; it’s an antacid base.
  - Neutral water won’t turn red litmus blue (no change), yet it still counts as “≥ neutral.”
  - Blood isn’t acidic; it’s kept slightly basic to buffer everyday acids.

- Same idea, different look:
  - “Which would calm stomach acid?” → antacids and bases: milk of magnesia, NaOH (though not for consumption), and blood’s buffering; water is neutral.
  - “Which taste/feel?” Sour → acid (lemon, gastric). Slippery/soapy or chalky-antacid → base (NaOH, milk of magnesia). Plain → neutral (water).

- Nature/engineering echoes:
  - Antacid tablets (like milk of magnesia) neutralize excess stomach acid.
  - Drain cleaners (strong bases) break greasy clogs.
  - Oceans and blood use mild basicity to buffer added acids.

## Think first: sour vs. slippery.
- Sour things (lemon juice, stomach acid) are acidic → pH < 7.
- Slippery/soapy things (NaOH, milk of magnesia) are basic → pH > 7.
- Pure water at room temperature is neutral → pH = 7.

## Why is neutral pH = 7 at 298 K?
- Water slightly splits itself: H2O ⇌ H+ + OH−
- At 25°C (298 K), the product [H+][OH−] = 1.0 × 10^-14.
- In pure water, [H+] = [OH−], so each is 1.0 × 10^-7 mol/L → pH = −log10[H+] = 7.

## Now check each substance:
- i) Gastric juice (stomach acid): very acidic, pH ≈ 1–3 → less than 7 → No
- ii) Blood: slightly basic, pH ≈ 7.35–7.45 → at least 7 → Yes
- iii) Aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH): strong base, pH > 7 → Yes
- iv) Pure water (at 298 K): neutral, pH = 7 → Yes
- v) Milk of magnesia (Mg(OH)2): antacid base, pH ≈ 10–11 → Yes
- vi) Lemon juice: acidic (citric acid), pH ≈ 2 → No

Count with pH ≥ 7: items ii, iii, iv, v → 4.

Answer: 4

## Quick exam tips:
- Neutral at 25°C means pH = 7 because [H+] = [OH−].
- Acidic: pH < 7 (sour). Basic: pH > 7 (slippery).
- Everyday anchors: lemon and gastric juice (acidic), antacids and NaOH (basic), pure water (neutral).

## Conceptual follow-ups:
- What if the temperature rises? Neutral water’s pH falls below 7 (e.g., ~6.8 at body temp), but it is still neutral because [H+] = [OH−]. Neutral does not always mean pH = 7 unless at 25°C.

## Misconception clinic:
- Many students think “neutral means pH 7 at any temperature.” Actually, pH 7 is neutral only at 25°C; neutrality means [H+] = [OH−].
- A common mistake is assuming “clear liquids are neutral.” Many strong acids/bases are colorless.
- Some think “blood is exactly 7.” It’s slightly basic: about 7.4.

## Practice checks:
- If [H+] = 1.0 × 10^-8 M at 25°C, is the solution acidic, neutral, or basic? (Basic; pH = 8.)
- Which is more basic: milk of magnesia or blood? (Milk of magnesia.)
- If pure water at 40°C has pH ≈ 6.8, is it acidic? (No; it’s neutral because [H+] = [OH−].)

## Reflective essence:
- Acidity and basicity are a balance, like a seesaw between H+ and OH−. Neutral is the balance point; temperature shifts the numbers, but equality still defines neutrality.
