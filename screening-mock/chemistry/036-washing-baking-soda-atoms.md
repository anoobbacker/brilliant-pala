# Question
Number of atoms in one formula unit of washing soda is '$x$' and number of atoms in one formula unit of baking soda is '$y$'. Give the value of $(x \times y)$

# Answer

## Quick visual reasoning
- Picture washing soda as “a sodium carbonate core holding 10 water droplets.”
  - Core: 2 sodium beads + 1 carbon bead + 3 oxygen beads.
  - Water droplets: 10 copies of (2 hydrogens + 1 oxygen) → 20 hydrogens + 10 oxygens.
  - Total atoms in one unit: 2 (Na) + 1 (C) + [3 + 10] (O) + 20 (H) = 36. So x = 36.

- Picture baking soda as “sodium + a hydrogen hitchhiker + a carbonate head.”
  - 1 sodium + 1 hydrogen + 1 carbon + 3 oxygens = 6 atoms. So y = 6.

- Multiply by grouping: six packs of 36 is five packs (180) plus one more (36) → 216.

Answer: 216

## Create twists
- Visual traps to avoid:
  - Forgetting the 10 water droplets stuck to washing soda’s core.
  - Mixing the oxygen counts: carbonate has 3 oxygens; the 10 waters bring 10 more.
  - Dropping the hydrogen in baking soda (it’s the “hydrogen carbonate” part).

- Same idea, different look:
  - Any “salt with a dot and some waters” means: keep the core, then add that many water droplets, each contributing two hydrogens and one oxygen to the atom count.
  - If a name says “hydrogen carbonate,” it’s the carbonate group with an extra hydrogen attached.

- Where this shows up in the real world:
  - Hydrated crystals (like washing soda) act like tiny sponges holding water inside their structure; heating drives those water beads off.
  - Baking soda’s extra hydrogen is why it fizzes with acids—there’s a built-in bubble-maker hiding in that atom count.

## Counting Atoms: Washing Soda vs Baking Soda

### Start with a real-world hook
- Washing soda is used in laundry; baking soda is used in cakes.
- Question: If you zoomed way in to a single “unit” of each solid, how many atoms are inside that one unit?

To answer, we need to think like a chemist: what is a “formula unit,” and how do we count atoms, especially when water is built into the crystal?

## Build from fundamentals

### What is a “formula unit”?
- Everyday idea: A “recipe card” for an ionic crystal—the smallest whole-number ratio of its ions.
- Technical term: The simplest chemical formula that represents one repeat unit in an ionic solid (not a molecule).

### Hydrates: salts that carry water inside
- Everyday idea: The crystal has water molecules tucked in like Lego pieces between blocks.
- Technical term: “Water of crystallization.” Written as “· xH2O” and counts as real atoms in the formula unit.

## Step-by-step atom counting

### 1) Washing soda: Na2CO3·10H2O
Break it into parts:
- Na2CO3 part: 2 Na + 1 C + 3 O = 6 atoms
- 10H2O part: each H2O has 2 H + 1 O = 3 atoms; ten waters = 10 × 3 = 30 atoms

Add them:
```math
x = (2 + 1 + 3) + 10 \times (2 + 1) = 6 + 30 = 36
```
So, one formula unit of washing soda has 36 atoms.

### 2) Baking soda: NaHCO3
Count directly:
- 1 Na + 1 H + 1 C + 3 O = 6 atoms
```math
y = 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 6
```

### Multiply
```math
x \times y = 36 \times 6 = 216
```

Answer: 216

## Analytical view (why the counting works)
- We’re “bookkeeping” atoms by summing every element’s count in the formula.
- Hydrate dot means addition: the water molecules are part of the same formula unit, so their atoms must be included.

---

## Experimental view (how you’d notice in a lab)
- Heat washing soda (Na2CO3·10H2O): it loses mass as water leaves, proving those water molecules were truly in the solid.
- Baking soda (NaHCO3) releases CO2 on heating or in acid—consistent with its hydrogen carbonate part.

---

## Intuitive view (quick checks)
- Water adds atoms fast: each H2O adds 3 atoms. Ten waters add 30 atoms—most of the total!
- Carbonates always have 3 oxygens in the CO3 part—don’t forget them.

> ### 🧠 Quick Exam Tips
> - Formula unit ≠ molecule for ionic solids; but counting atoms is the same: add up subscripts.
> - In hydrates, add atoms from the dot-water: xH2O contributes 3x atoms.
> - For Na2CO3·10H2O, total atoms = (2+1+3) + 10×(2+1) = 36.
> - For NaHCO3, total atoms = 1+1+1+3 = 6.
> - Final: 36 × 6 = 216.

## Misconception clinic
- Many students think “the dot means separate, so don’t count it.” But actually, the water is inside the crystal—count it.
- A common mistake is assuming CO3 has 4 oxygens because “carbonate sounds big.” It’s always 3 oxygens in CO3.
- Some forget that H2O contributes 3 atoms, not 2. It’s 2 H and 1 O.

## Mini practice questions
1) How many atoms in one formula unit of CuSO4·5H2O?
   - CuSO4: 1+1+4 = 6; 5H2O: 5×3 = 15; total = 21.
2) Generalize: atoms in Na2CO3·xH2O?

```math
   2 + 1 + 3 + 3x = 6 + 3x
   ```
3) How many atoms in KHCO3?
   - K + H + C + 3O = 1+1+1+3 = 6.
