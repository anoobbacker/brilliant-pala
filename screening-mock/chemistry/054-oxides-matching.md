## Think like a chemist: what does an oxide “do” in water or with acids/bases?

Start from what you’ve seen:
- Ashes and quicklime (from metals) feel “soapy” and react with water to make alkaline solutions (basic).
- Gases like CO₂ (from breath or soda) make water slightly sour (acidic) and react with bases.
- Some oxides behave both ways depending on who they “meet” — acids or bases. That’s amphoteric.

Why does this happen? Oxygen in oxides is usually holding extra electron density. In water:
- If the oxide easily gives “basic” behavior (producing OH⁻), we call it a basic oxide.
- If the oxide helps produce an acid (like H₂CO₃), we call it an acidic oxide.
- If it can act either way, it’s amphoteric.

A deep reason (first principles):
- Metal oxides tend to be ionic (metal cation M²⁺ with oxide O²⁻). The oxide ion O²⁻ strongly grabs H⁺ from water, creating OH⁻ — that’s basic behavior.
- Nonmetal oxides tend to be covalent molecules (like CO₂). In water they form acids (like H₂CO₃) — acidic behavior.
- “Borderline” metal oxides (like ZnO, Al₂O₃) have significant covalent character and can react with both acids and bases — amphoteric.

We’ll use these ideas plus simple experiments to match each oxide.

## Analyze each oxide from first principles

### (b) CaO — a metal oxide
- Nature: Calcium is a highly electropositive metal. CaO is largely ionic: Ca²⁺ and O²⁻.
- What does O²⁻ do in water? It pulls H⁺ from water, making OH⁻. So it creates a base.
  
  Experimentally:

```math
  \text{CaO (s) + H}_2\text{O (l)} \rightarrow \text{Ca(OH)}_2 \text{ (aq)}
  ```
  - The aqueous solution of Ca(OH)₂ is called “lime water” (clear, mildly basic).
  - This is why builders “slake” quicklime to make slaked lime or lime water.

- Conclusion for CaO:
  - Nature: basic (Column–II: iii)
  - Feature: forms lime water (Column–III: p)

### (c) CO₂ — a nonmetal oxide
- Nature: CO₂ is a covalent molecule (nonmetal + oxygen).
- In water, CO₂ forms carbonic acid:

```math
  \text{CO}_2 \text{ (g) + H}_2\text{O (l)} \rightleftharpoons \text{H}_2\text{CO}_3 \text{ (aq)}
  ```
  That’s acidic behavior (it can release H⁺).

- Classic test: Bubble CO₂ through lime water (Ca(OH)₂). It turns milky due to CaCO₃ precipitate:

```math
  \text{Ca(OH)}_2 \text{ (aq) + CO}_2 \text{ (g)} \rightarrow \text{CaCO}_3 \text{ (s) + H}_2\text{O (l)}
  ```
  The white CaCO₃ makes the milky appearance.

- Conclusion for CO₂:
  - Nature: acidic (Column–II: i)
  - Feature: turns lime water milky (Column–III: q)

### (a) ZnO — a “borderline” metal oxide
- Zinc is a metal, but Zn²⁺ is small and fairly polarizing. This gives ZnO some covalent character and an “in-between” behavior.
- Test with an acid (acts basic):

```math
  \text{ZnO (s) + 2HCl (aq)} \rightarrow \text{ZnCl}_2 \text{ (aq) + H}_2\text{O (l)}
  ```
- Test with a base (acts acidic), forming zincate:

```math
  \text{ZnO (s) + 2NaOH (aq) + H}_2\text{O (l)} \rightarrow \text{Na}_2[\text{Zn(OH)}_4] \text{ (aq)}
  ```
  (In simpler notation you’ll also see: ZnO + 2NaOH → Na₂ZnO₂ + H₂O.)

- Industrial origin: ZnO is formed by roasting zinc sulfide (ZnS) in oxygen — a common metallurgy step (removing sulfur as SO₂):

```math
  2\text{ZnS (s) + 3O}_2 \text{ (g)} \rightarrow 2\text{ZnO (s) + 2SO}_2 \text{ (g)}
  ```

- Conclusion for ZnO:
  - Nature: amphoteric (Column–II: ii)
  - Feature: formed by roasting sulphide (Column–III: r)

## Put it together: the correct matching

- (a) ZnO → (ii) amphoteric, (r) formed by roasting sulphide
- (b) CaO → (iii) basic, (p) forms lime water
- (c) CO₂ → (i) acidic, (q) turns lime water milky

This corresponds to Option 2.

## Multiple ways to know this (analytical vs experimental)

- Analytical reasoning:
  - Metal oxide (ionic, O²⁻) → tends to produce OH⁻ in water → basic (CaO).
  - Nonmetal oxide (covalent) → tends to form oxyacids in water → acidic (CO₂).
  - Borderline cations (small, moderately charged) polarize O²⁻ → amphoteric (ZnO).

- Experimental tests:
  - Add water to CaO: it heats up and forms Ca(OH)₂ (lime water).
  - Bubble CO₂ through lime water: turns milky (CaCO₃).
  - React ZnO with both HCl and NaOH: it dissolves in both, showing amphoterism.

---

## Quick checks (stoichiometry sanity)

- CaO + H₂O → Ca(OH)₂: atoms balanced; Ca:1, O:2, H:2.
- Ca(OH)₂ + CO₂ → CaCO₃ + H₂O: Ca:1, C:1, O:3 (LHS: 2+1=3), H:2.
- 2ZnS + 3O₂ → 2ZnO + 2SO₂: Zn:2, S:2, O:6 both sides.

## Final Answer
Option 2

## Conceptual follow-up questions

1. Why does excess CO₂ eventually clear the milky lime water? (Hint: CaCO₃ can further react to form soluble bicarbonate.)
2. Predict the nature of SO₂ and P₄O₁₀ in water. What do they form?
3. Would MgO behave more like CaO or ZnO? Justify using ionic size and polarizing power.
4. Can an oxide’s behavior change with temperature or hydration state? Give examples.

## Application questions

- How does the CO₂–lime water reaction relate to:
  - CO₂ scrubbing in industrial chimneys?
  - Setting and durability of lime-based mortars?
- Why is ZnO used in sunscreen and ceramics? How do its amphoteric and thermal properties help?
- How does roasting sulfide ores (like ZnS) reflect environmental concerns about SO₂ emissions?

---

## Common misconceptions and how to avoid them

- “All metal oxides are basic.” Not always — some (Al₂O₃, ZnO, PbO) are amphoteric. Think about cation size and charge density.
- “CO₂ is neutral because it’s a gas.” Acidity/basicity is about reactions, not physical state. CO₂ forms an acid in water.
- “Lime water” vs “milk of lime”: lime water is a clear solution of Ca(OH)₂; milk of lime is a suspension. The milky test for CO₂ is due to CaCO₃ precipitate, not undissolved Ca(OH)₂.

---

## Extension challenges

- Design a simple lab flowchart to classify an unknown oxide as acidic, basic, or amphoteric using only water, dilute HCl, and NaOH.
- Model the effect of bubbling air vs exhaled breath through lime water. Which turns milky faster and why?
- Compare amphoterism of Al₂O₃ and ZnO using Lewis acid–base theory and Fajans’ rules.

## Reflective insight: the essence of oxide behavior

The “why” behind oxide nature is the balance between ionic O²⁻ (which makes OH⁻, thus basic) and covalent bonding (which tends to form oxyacids). Metals push oxides toward ionic/basic; nonmetals toward covalent/acidic. Borderline cations blur the line, creating amphoteric behavior. Once you see this continuum, you can predict an unfamiliar oxide’s behavior by reasoning from bonding, structure, and simple water reactions.
