# Question
Number of atoms present in a molecule of hydrogen is ...........

# Answer

## Quick visual reasoning
- Picture each hydrogen atom as a ball with one empty hook.
- Two such balls meet: each hook grabs the other. Now no hooks are left loose, so the pair is stable and travels together as the “molecule.”
- Try three: the middle would need two hooks to hold both neighbors, but each hydrogen has only one. That trio can’t stay whole; it snaps into a happy pair plus a single, and the single soon pairs up with another single.
- Bigger clusters just fall apart into separate pairs for the same reason.

Answer: Two.

## Create twists
- Visual trap: Mixing up “atom” and “molecule.” One atom is a single ball; the molecule of hydrogen is the smallest stable bundle—two balls holding one handshake.
- Visual trap: Guessing three or four. With only one hook per atom, only pairs can have zero loose ends; anything larger leaves someone unmatched and splits into pairs.
- Same idea, different look: Any element whose atoms each have one open “hook” will prefer to travel as pairs.
- In real life: In fuel cells, a catalyst first pulls the two hydrogen atoms apart (breaks the handshake), proving they normally arrive as pairs before reacting.

### Start from everyday thinking

Imagine each hydrogen atom as a tiny sphere with one electron. Atoms “like” to be stable, and for tiny atoms like hydrogen, stability means having 2 electrons in the first shell (like helium). A single hydrogen has only 1 electron, so two hydrogens come close and share their electrons. That sharing is a covalent bond.

Textual picture:
- Before bonding: H· + ·H  (each dot is one electron)
- After bonding: H:H or H–H  (shared pair forms a bond)

So one molecule of hydrogen gas is H₂ — made of 2 hydrogen atoms.

```math
\text{H} + \text{H} \longrightarrow \text{H}_2
```

### Analytical view (valency logic)

- Hydrogen’s valency is 1 (it needs 1 more electron to fill its first shell).
- The simplest way for hydrogen to be stable is to pair up and share 1 electron each.
- Therefore, the stable molecule is H₂: two atoms per molecule.

### Experimental clue (how scientists knew)

If 2 volumes of hydrogen react with 1 volume of oxygen to form 2 volumes of steam (at the same temperature and pressure), Avogadro’s idea (equal volumes of gas at the same conditions contain equal numbers of molecules) implies hydrogen and oxygen gases are diatomic (H₂ and O₂). This matches the 2-atom picture.

Answer: 2

### Misconception clinic
- Many students think “a hydrogen molecule has 1 atom because hydrogen’s symbol is H.” But symbols represent elements, not the number of atoms per molecule. The molecule of hydrogen gas is H₂, not H.
- A single hydrogen atom (H) can exist, but as a gas it’s highly reactive; under normal conditions hydrogen prefers the stable H₂ form.

### Quick practice
- How many atoms in a molecule of oxygen gas? Answer: 2 (O₂).
- How many atoms in ozone? Answer: 3 (O₃).
- How many atoms in helium gas? Answer: 1 (He, monatomic).

> ### Reflective essence
> Stability in nature often comes from sharing or pairing to complete “sets.” For atoms, that means filling electron shells; for hydrogen, the simplest stable partnership is a pair—H₂.
