   D) CaO

# Answer
## Quick visual reasoning
- Picture dropping a bit of calcium into water: tiny bubbles appear and a white cloud blooms around the metal.
- Clear water means whatever forms dissolves completely. Cloudy, milky water means tiny solid particles are floating and scattering light, like diluted paint.
- The very first thing water makes with calcium is the “slaked lime” solid that only partly dissolves, so you see that white cloud right away.
- A carbonate would need carbon dioxide from air or breath to appear; that’s a second step, not the first moment calcium meets water.
- Chloride needs chloride present (like salt), which plain water doesn’t have. Oxide is what you get when calcium meets oxygen, not water.

So the milky look at the start is from calcium hydroxide.

## Create twists
- Common trap: mixing up two “milky” scenes.
  - Calcium + water → immediate milky due to calcium hydroxide.
  - Blowing into clear limewater → turns milky later due to calcium carbonate.
  Spot it: Ask “Where did carbon dioxide come from?” If none was added, it’s the hydroxide.

- Same idea in a different-looking problem:
  - Sodium in water often leaves the liquid clear because its product dissolves well—no milkiness.
  - Magnesium with hot water gives faint cloudiness because its product barely dissolves.
  Use the “clear vs cloudy” test: clear = dissolves well; cloudy = tiny undissolved solid.

- In nature/engineering:
  - Whitewash: mixing water with quicklime makes a milky slurry of slaked lime—the same cloudy look you saw with calcium in water. This confirms the identity of the white cloud.
  
## Why does water look milky when calcium is added?

Start with a simple observation: Milk looks white because tiny particles scatter light. Clear water looks clear because there are no floating particles big enough to scatter light.

So if plain water suddenly looks milky, it usually means tiny solid particles have formed and are floating around (a suspension), bouncing light back to your eyes.

## What actually happens when calcium meets water?

Think cause → effect at the particle level:
- Calcium metal wants to lose two electrons to become Ca²⁺. Metals like to do that.
- Water molecules can accept those electrons and, in the process, release hydrogen gas and form hydroxide ions.

Put those ideas together and balance atoms logically:
- One Ca atom becomes Ca²⁺ (gave away 2 electrons).
- Two water molecules provide two H atoms to make one H₂ gas molecule.
- The leftover pieces form calcium hydroxide.

Balanced reaction:
```math
\text{Ca (s)} + 2\,\text{H}_2\text{O (l)} \rightarrow \text{Ca(OH)}_2 \text{(s/aq)} + \text{H}_2 \text{(g)}
```

Two key observations:
- Bubbles: hydrogen gas, H₂.
- Milkiness: tiny solid particles of calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)₂, which is only slightly soluble in water.

So the milky appearance is due to Ca(OH)₂ particles scattering light.

Answer: A) Ca(OH)₂

## Why not the other options?

- B) CaCO₃: That milky solid forms when carbon dioxide is bubbled into lime water (a solution of Ca(OH)₂). CO₂ isn’t present in pure water initially. Different situation.
- C) CaCl₂: Needs chloride ions (like from HCl), not just water.
- D) CaO: Quicklime actually reacts with water to form Ca(OH)₂; it’s a reactant in “slaking,” not a product here.

## Visual aid (described)

Imagine:
- A grey calcium piece dropped in water.
- Tiny bubbles of gas rising from its surface (H₂).
- A faint white cloud forming around the metal and spreading—those are fine Ca(OH)₂ particles making the water look milky.

If you filter and let the clear liquid stand, the clear solution is called “lime water.” Passing CO₂ through that clear lime water then turns it milky due to CaCO₃.

## Analytical, intuitive, and experimental angles

- Analytical view:
  - Reaction: Ca + 2H₂O → Ca(OH)₂ + H₂
  - Ca(OH)₂ has low solubility; excess forms a suspension → milky.
- Intuitive view:
  - Metal gives electrons, water frees hydrogen gas, leftover pieces form a base (alkaline).
- Experimental view:
  - Test with universal indicator: solution turns blue/purple (alkaline).
  - Filter the milky mixture: filtrate becomes clear (lime water).
  - Bubble CO₂ into the clear filtrate: turns milky (now CaCO₃).

> - Calcium + water → calcium hydroxide + hydrogen: Ca + 2H₂O → Ca(OH)₂ + H₂
> - Milky on adding calcium: Ca(OH)₂
> - Milky on bubbling CO₂ through lime water: CaCO₃
> - Excess CO₂ clears the milkiness: formation of soluble Ca(HCO₃)₂

## Conceptual follow-ups

- What if you bubble CO₂ into the milky calcium-water mixture? It often turns even milkier (now CaCO₃ forms from Ca(OH)₂), then with excess CO₂ it clears because Ca(HCO₃)₂ is soluble.
- What if you used magnesium? It reacts very slowly with cold water (a thin oxide layer protects it), faster with steam to form MgO and H₂.
- What about sodium/potassium? Much more vigorous—heat and flames—still forming hydroxide and hydrogen.

## Applications

- Slaked lime: CaO + H₂O → Ca(OH)₂ used in mortar and whitewashing; the setting involves CO₂ from air forming CaCO₃.
- Water hardness: Temporary hardness often due to Ca(HCO₃)₂; boiling removes it by forming CaCO₃.

---

## Misconception clinic

- Many students think “milky = CaCO₃ always.” But with calcium + water, no CO₂ is required; the milkiness is Ca(OH)₂.
- A common mistake is assuming “dissolved means invisible.” Slightly soluble solids often leave suspended particles that make mixtures look cloudy.
- Some assume CaO forms because they remember “lime.” Actually, CaO reacts with water; it’s not produced by water.

## Practice questions

1) When CO₂ is bubbled through clear lime water, it turns milky because of:
   - A) Ca(OH)₂
   - B) CaCO₃
   - C) CaO
   - D) CaCl₂
   Correct: B

2) Predict the gas evolved when calcium reacts with water. How would you test it quickly?
   - Hydrogen; a lighted splint gives a ‘pop’ sound.

3) If excess CO₂ is bubbled into a milky lime water solution, it becomes clear. Name the soluble compound formed.
   - Calcium hydrogen carbonate, Ca(HCO₃)₂.

4) Balance: Ca + H₂O → ? + H₂
   - Ca + 2H₂O → Ca(OH)₂ + H₂

> ### 🌱 Reflective essence
> When a metal meets water, think electrons moving, bonds rearranging, and new particles forming. The appearance you see—clear, cloudy, or milky—is just light telling you about particle size and solubility. Nature’s patterns are visible if you ask, “Who is giving electrons, who is accepting, and what tiny pieces are floating around?”
