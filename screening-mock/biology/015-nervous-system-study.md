## Question
The study of nervous system and its disorders is called

**Options:**

1. Neurogenesis
2. Haematology
3. Neuroglia
4. Neurology

## Reasoning from first principles (built from everyday meaning)
- Start with an intuition: Your body has “wires” (nerves) that carry signals so you can sense, think, and move. When those wires or the central hub (brain/spinal cord) have problems, a medical specialty studies and treats them.
- Language encodes that idea:
  - “Neuro-” comes from Greek “neuron,” meaning nerve.
  - “-logy” comes from “logos,” meaning study or knowledge.
- Put together: “Neurology” literally means “the study of the nervous system.” In medicine, “the study of X” naturally includes understanding its disorders, because doctors need to know both normal function and what goes wrong to diagnose and treat.

### Option-by-option analysis (eliminate by meaning)
- 1) Neurogenesis
  - “-genesis” = origin/creation. So neurogenesis is the creation of new neurons (a process), not the study of the whole system and its disorders.
- 2) Haematology (Hematology)
  - “Haema/Haemo/Heema” = blood. So haematology is the study of blood, not nerves.
- 3) Neuroglia
  - “Glia” = glue. Neuroglia are the support cells in the nervous system (e.g., astrocytes, oligodendrocytes), not the discipline that studies disorders.
- 4) Neurology
  - “Neuro” (nerves) + “-logy” (study) = the medical specialty focused on the nervous system and its diseases (e.g., stroke, epilepsy, migraine, multiple sclerosis).

### Two mental models to lock it in
- City analogy:
  - Blood system = roads and traffic (haematology studies this).
  - Nervous system = electrical cables and control center (neurology studies this).
  - Making new cables (neurogenesis) is a process within the city.
  - Cable support/insulation (neuroglia) are helper components, not the department.
- Medical-language pattern:
  - Cardiology (heart), Dermatology (skin), Endocrinology (hormones), Neurology (nervous system). “-logy” = study of system + disorders.

## Answer
4) Neurology

## Multiple approaches to the answer
- Linguistic analysis: “Neuro-” + “-logy” = study of nerves.
- Process of elimination: The other three are either a different system (blood) or parts/processes (glia, genesis), not a field.
- Real-world role: A neurologist diagnoses and treats epilepsy, stroke, Parkinson’s disease, neuropathies, etc. That matches “study of the nervous system and its disorders.”

## Real-world connections
- Tools: MRI, CT, EEG, nerve conduction studies help neurologists map function and find disorders.
- Innovations: Brain–computer interfaces, deep brain stimulation, and neurorehabilitation arise from neurology and neuroscience working together.

## Conceptual follow-up questions
- If “-logy” = study, what would “neuroanatomy” and “neurophysiology” specifically focus on?
- Which specialty focuses on surgery of the nervous system: neurology or neurosurgery, and why?
- How does psychiatry differ from neurology in dealing with brain-related conditions?
- If “-itis” means inflammation, what does “encephalitis” mean?

## Application questions
- A patient has sudden weakness on one side and slurred speech. Which specialty primarily evaluates this emergency, and which tests might be used?
- Brain–computer interfaces convert neural signals into actions. Which parts of neurology and engineering must collaborate to make this safe and effective?
- Multiple sclerosis involves immune attack on myelin (a glial function). How do neurology and immunology intersect in treating it?

## Common misconceptions and how to avoid them
- “Neuroglia is a field.” False—glia are support cells; the field is neurology (clinical) or neuroscience (broader research).
- “Neurogenesis is the same as neurology.” No—neurogenesis is a biological process; neurology is the medical specialty.
- “Haematology is about nerves.” It’s about blood. Use the root “haema/hemo” to remember.
- “Neurology does brain surgery.” That’s neurosurgery; neurologists diagnose and medically manage.

## Extension challenges
- Decode these using roots:
  - “Electroencephalography,” “myelopathy,” “neuromuscular,” “hemianopsia,” “glioblastoma.”
- Create your own terms: If “neuro” is nerves and “-toxic” is poison, what does “neurotoxic” mean? If “-graphy” is recording, what might “neurography” be?
- Map the ecosystem: Distinguish roles of neurology, neurosurgery, psychiatry, neuroradiology, and neuropsychology in managing a single case (e.g., traumatic brain injury).

## Reflective insight
The essence is that scientific and medical terms are built like Lego blocks: prefixes (system), roots (core idea), and suffixes (type of work). When you decode the parts—“neuro” (nerves) + “-logy” (study)—you can reason out the meaning without memorizing. This language-first approach scales to any new term you meet in science.
