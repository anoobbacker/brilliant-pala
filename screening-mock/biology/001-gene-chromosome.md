## Question
Site of gene (allele) on a chromosome is called

**Options:**

1. locate
2. location
3. locus
4. target


### Build-up from first principles

#### 1) Start with what we see
- People can have the same species traits (two eyes) but differ in details (eye color).
- Those differences run in families, so the “instructions” must be carried inside cells and passed on when cells divide and when parents have children.

#### 2) Where do the instructions live?
- Inside the nucleus, long DNA molecules carry instructions.
- Each long DNA molecule, tightly packaged, is a chromosome.
- Along a chromosome, the DNA sequence is like a very long sentence of letters (A, T, G, C). Different stretches of this sequence do different jobs.

#### 3) What is a gene? What is an allele?
- A gene is a stretch of DNA that has instructions to build something (often a protein) that affects a trait.
- An allele is a version of that gene—same “chapter” in the book, but with slight spelling differences in the text.
  - Example: A gene for eye color can have alleles that lead to brown or blue, based on small sequence changes.

#### 4) Why we need a word for “address”
- Chromosomes are linear. Every base (letter) has a position along the line.
- To discuss a gene precisely, we need to say where it sits along that chromosome—its address.
- In genetics, that address is called a locus (plural: loci).
  - Think of a street: the chromosome is the street, the gene is the house, and the locus is the house number.

#### 5) How do we know loci are real, not just a naming trick?
- Homologous chromosomes (one from each parent) carry the same set of loci in the same order. That’s why, for any gene, you can carry two alleles—one at the same locus on each homolog.
- During meiosis, homologs pair up by aligning matching loci. This pairing allows crossing over (swapping segments), which makes sense only if each gene occupies a definite position.
- Experimental evidence:
  - Cytogenetics: Under a microscope, stained chromosomes show banding patterns. Genes can be mapped to bands (e.g., 7q31).
  - FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization): A glowing probe binds a precise DNA sequence, lighting up its locus.
  - Linkage mapping: The closer two loci are, the less often crossing over separates them; recombination frequency reveals order and distance along the chromosome.
  - Genome sequencing: We can assign coordinates (in base pairs) to every gene—an exact numeric locus.

#### 6) Scale and coordinates (intuitive “dimensional” sense)
- DNA has a measurable length: about 0.34 nm per base pair (bp).
- Genes often span thousands of bp (kilobases, kb).
- A locus can be specified by coordinates: chromosome number + arm + band or exact bp position (e.g., the CFTR gene is at chromosome 7q31.2, around 117 million bp from the chromosome’s start).

#### 7) Clarifying the options
- “locate” is a verb (to find), not a noun for the position.
- “location” is a general word, but the precise genetic term is “locus.”
- “target” means a goal or thing aimed at, not the fixed genomic address.
- Therefore, the correct technical term for the site of a gene (allele) on a chromosome is “locus.”

Correct Answer: 3) locus

## Why this matters (cause-effect connections)
- Mendel’s laws make sense because alleles are different versions of a gene at the same locus on homologous chromosomes. They segregate when homologs separate in meiosis.
- Disorders and traits can be traced to specific loci (e.g., HBB locus on 11p15.5 in sickle cell disease; CFTR locus on 7q31.2 in cystic fibrosis).
- In breeding, conservation, and medicine, knowing the locus lets us track, diagnose, and potentially edit the right part of the genome.

## Conceptual follow-up questions
1. If two alleles are at the same locus, why can’t you have more than two alleles in one person for an autosomal gene?
2. How does crossing over during meiosis support the idea that genes lie in a linear order along chromosomes?
3. If two traits are almost always inherited together, what does that suggest about the distance between their loci?
4. Can a locus exist even if we haven’t identified a functional gene there yet? Explain.
5. If a population has many alleles for a trait, what remains the same across all individuals regarding that trait’s gene?

## Application questions
1. Medical genetics: How does knowing the locus of a disease gene help in designing a diagnostic test for carriers?
2. Agriculture: Breeders want drought tolerance and high yield. How does mapping their loci speed up marker-assisted selection?
3. Conservation biology: How can loci-based genetic markers help identify distinct populations for protection?
4. Biotechnology: CRISPR needs a guide RNA. Why does the concept of a precise locus make CRISPR targeting possible?

## Common misconceptions and reasoning traps
- “Allele equals gene.” Correction: An allele is a version of a gene at the same locus; the locus is the address, the gene is the functional instruction, and the allele is the variant text.
- “Different alleles must be on different chromosomes.” Correction: Different alleles of the same gene occupy the same locus on homologous chromosomes.
- “Locus is only for coding DNA.” Correction: Locus just means position; it can refer to noncoding regions too.
- “If two genes are linked, they must be the same locus.” Correction: Linked genes are close loci, not the same locus.

## Extension challenges
1. Design a simple linkage-mapping experiment in fruit flies using two visible traits. How would recombination frequencies let you infer the order and approximate distances of their loci?
2. Explain how unequal crossing over could duplicate a gene, creating two similar genes at different loci. What evolutionary outcomes might follow?
3. Compare cytogenetic coordinates (like 11p15.5) with sequence coordinates (exact bp positions). What are the pros and cons of each system?
4. Propose how whole-genome sequencing could discover a novel disease locus in families with an inherited disorder of unknown cause.

## Reflective insight
The essence of “locus” is the idea of a fixed address on a linear information map. Biology becomes predictable when we treat DNA not as a vague “code” but as an ordered street of positions. Genes are the houses, alleles are their differing interiors, and heredity works because the map—the loci—stay in the same order across generations. Once you see heredity as movement along a coordinate system, everything from Mendel’s laws to modern genome editing falls naturally into place.
