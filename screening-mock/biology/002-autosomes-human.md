## Question
The number of autosomes in human is

**Options:**

1. 38
2. 40
3. 42
4. 44

### Build-up from first principles

1. Start with an everyday model
   - Imagine a toolkit where each tool type comes in two versions: one from your mother, one from your father. That’s how your body stores instructions (genes) on chromosomes: in pairs.
   - Why pairs? Because to keep chromosome numbers stable across generations, parents must contribute half the set each. Otherwise, the number would double every generation.

2. Why “half-sets” exist (the logic of meiosis)
   - If every parent gave a full set, child counts would explode (46 → 92 → 184…).
   - Nature solves this with meiosis: making gametes (sperm/egg) that carry half the number (a “haploid” set).
   - So there are two key counts:
     - Haploid number (n): chromosomes in a gamete.
     - Diploid number (2n): chromosomes in a body (somatic) cell.

3. How many types are in the human set?
   - When scientists stain and line up human chromosomes (a karyotype), they see distinct “types” by size/banding.
   - In humans, there are 23 types in a haploid set: 22 “ordinary” types plus 1 sex chromosome type (X or Y).

4. What are autosomes?
   - Autosomes = all non-sex chromosomes.
   - Sex chromosomes = the specialized pair (XX in females, XY in males).
   - So in a haploid set: 22 autosome types + 1 sex type.
   - In a diploid body cell: two copies of each type.

5. Counting, step by step
   - Total chromosomes in a human somatic cell:
     ```math
     2n = 2 \times 23 = 46
     ```
   - Autosomes in a human somatic cell:
     ```math
     \text{Autosomes} = 2 \times 22 = 44
     ```
   - This is true for both males and females; only the sex pair differs (XX vs XY), not the autosome count.

6. Experimental cross-check (how we know)
   - Karyotyping with stains (like Giemsa) consistently shows 46 chromosomes arranged as 22 pairs of autosomes plus one pair of sex chromosomes.
   - This was established in classic cytogenetics (e.g., Tjio and Levan, 1956).

Therefore, the correct option is 44.

## Multiple views that agree

- Logical inheritance view: Two copies (mom + dad) of each of 22 non-sex types ⇒ 44 autosomes.
- Microscopy view: 22 matching pairs (autosomes) + 1 sex pair = 23 pairs total ⇒ 46 chromosomes ⇒ 44 autosomes.
- Genetic stability view: Halving in gametes (22 autosomes + X or Y) and restoring in fertilization ⇒ 44 autosomes in the zygote.

Answer: 44

## Quick checks and edge cases

- Gamete counts:
  ```math
  \text{Per egg/sperm} = 22\ \text{autosomes} + 1\ \text{sex (X or Y)} = 23
  ```
- Variations:
  - Down syndrome (trisomy 21): 47 total chromosomes, autosomes = 45 (since chromosome 21 has an extra copy).
  - Turner syndrome (XO): 45 total chromosomes, autosomes still 44 (the missing one is a sex chromosome).
  - So “44 autosomes” is the normal human baseline.

## Conceptual follow-up questions

1. Why do gametes carry only one of each chromosome type? What would happen if they didn’t?
2. Does a male have fewer autosomes than a female because the Y is small? Why or why not?
3. If a species has 2n = 36 and uses an XY system, how many autosomes are in its somatic cells? In its gametes?
4. In humans with 47 chromosomes due to trisomy 21, how many autosomes and how many sex chromosomes are present?

## Application questions

- How does knowing “22 autosome types + 1 sex type” guide prenatal karyotyping and genetic counseling?
- In IVF or cancer diagnostics, why does counting autosomes help detect chromosomal abnormalities?
- How do chromosome numbers influence species comparisons (e.g., human 46 vs chimpanzee 48) and evolutionary inferences?

## Common misconceptions and how to avoid them

- “Autosomes = 22” confusion:
  - Trap: mixing “pairs” with “total.” There are 22 pairs (types), which equals 44 autosomes total in somatic cells.
- “Males have 43 autosomes because of Y”:
  - False. The size of the Y doesn’t change the count. Both sexes have 44 autosomes.
- “More chromosomes mean a more complex organism”:
  - False. Ferns and some salamanders have more chromosomes than humans. Number ≠ complexity.

## Extension challenges

1. A plant has n = 12 (haploid). In a somatic cell, how many autosomes would there be if it has an XY system? What if it’s XX/XY but polyploid (4n)?
2. Explain Robertsonian translocation: a human can have 45 chromosomes yet be healthy. How can autosome DNA amount stay nearly the same while the count changes?
3. Devise a simple school-lab demonstration or model (using colored paper strips) to simulate meiosis and show why gametes end up with 22 autosomes + X/Y.

## Reflective insight

The deep “why” is about stable information transfer. Chromosomes are matched carriers of instructions. To keep the blueprint stable across generations, the system halves the set in gametes and restores it at fertilization. Among these, autosomes are the general-purpose instruction pairs—22 types—duplicated to make 44 in our body cells. Once you see chromosomes as paired instruction sets (types × copies), the count 44 follows naturally:
```math
\text{Autosomes in humans} = (\text{number of autosome types}) \times (\text{copies per somatic cell}) = 22 \times 2 = 44
```
