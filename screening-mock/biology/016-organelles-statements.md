D. Cell wall is present in all cells.

How many statements are correct?

## Step-by-step reasoning from first principles

Let’s build from everyday experience. Think of a cell like a miniature city:
- A flexible city boundary (the cell membrane) separates inside from outside.
- Some tasks need special rooms with walls to control conditions (membrane-bound organelles).
- Other tasks are done by portable machines sitting out in the open workshop (non-membranous structures).

Now evaluate each statement by asking: What problem is the cell solving, and what structure best solves it?

### A. “Ribosomes are membrane-bound organelles.”
- What is a ribosome for? It’s a molecular machine that reads mRNA and strings amino acids into proteins. For this, large molecules (mRNA, tRNA, amino acids, GTP, proteins) must freely come and go.
- What does a membrane do? A membrane is like an oily film (lipid bilayer) that blocks most big or charged molecules unless there are special gates. Membranes are great when you want to isolate and control an internal environment (like a room with a door), not when you need constant free access for large parts.
- Actual observation: Under electron microscopes, ribosomes appear as dense particles with no surrounding membrane. They can float freely in the cytoplasm or attach to the rough ER surface, but they are not enclosed by a membrane.
- Logic check with bacteria: Prokaryotes (bacteria) don’t have internal membranes, yet they make proteins just fine because their ribosomes are not membrane-bound.
- Conclusion: False. Ribosomes are not membrane-bound organelles.

### B. “Mitochondria are called the powerhouse of the cell.”
- What energy job must every cell do? Convert the energy stored in food into a usable form for cell work (moving, building, transporting).
- What “currency” do cells use? ATP. Its phosphate bonds store readily usable energy that can be quickly cashed in by enzymes.
- What do mitochondria do? They run aerobic respiration, transferring energy from glucose to ATP. Summarized as:

```math
\text{C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6 + 6\,\text{O}_2 \rightarrow 6\,\text{CO}_2 + 6\,\text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{ATP (≈30–32 per glucose)}
```

- Why membranes here? Mitochondria use their inner membrane like a dam to hold a proton gradient; the “water pressure” drives ATP synthase turbines to make ATP. No membrane = no gradient = no ATP payoff from oxygen.
- Conclusion: True. They are rightly called the cell’s “powerhouse” because they produce most ATP during aerobic respiration.

### C. “Chloroplasts are absent in animal cells.”
- What is a chloroplast for? Capturing light energy to make sugar (photosynthesis):

```math
6\,\text{CO}_2 + 6\,\text{H}_2\text{O} \xrightarrow{\text{light}} \text{C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6 + 6\,\text{O}_2
```

- Strategy difference: Plants are autotrophs (make food from light); animals are heterotrophs (eat food). Animals don’t photosynthesize, so they don’t need chloroplasts.
- Real-world check: Animal cells lack chloroplasts. Rare curiosities (e.g., some sea slugs that “steal” chloroplasts) are exceptions, not the rule in IGCSE biology.
- Conclusion: True. Animal cells do not have chloroplasts.

### D. “Cell wall is present in all cells.”
- Purpose of a cell wall: It’s a tough outer layer for shape and protection. In plants, it resists swelling from water influx (turgor), letting stems/leaves stay firm without bones.
- Who has it? Plants (cellulose walls), fungi (chitin walls), most bacteria (peptidoglycan walls).
- Who doesn’t? Animal cells lack cell walls; they rely on flexible membranes, cytoskeletons, and extracellular matrix. Flexibility aids movement, engulfing food, and forming varied tissues.
- Conclusion: False. Not all cells have a cell wall.

### Tally
- Correct: B, C
- Incorrect: A, D
- Number of correct statements: 2

## Answer
2 statements are correct (B and C).

## Multiple approaches (how we know)
- Experimental: Electron microscopy shows ribosomes without membranes; mitochondria and chloroplasts have double membranes with visible internal structures (cristae, thylakoids).
- Functional logic: Tasks needing isolation and gradients require membranes (mitochondria, chloroplasts). Tasks needing free molecular traffic (protein synthesis) don’t (ribosomes).
- Evolutionary lens: Prokaryotes lack internal membranes but have ribosomes—impossible if ribosomes needed membranes. Endosymbiosis explains double-membraned mitochondria/chloroplasts.

## Final answer
2 statements are correct (B and C).

## Conceptual follow-up questions
1. If ribosomes needed a membrane, what problems would that create for protein synthesis speed and flexibility?
2. Why do mitochondria need two membranes, not just one?
3. If an animal cell were given chloroplasts, what other changes would it need to perform photosynthesis efficiently?
4. Why might plants benefit from rigid cell walls while animals benefit from flexible cells?

## Application questions
- Medicine: Some antibiotics target bacterial ribosomes without harming human ribosomes. Why is this possible, and how does it relate to statement A?
- Bioengineering: Algae bioreactors use chloroplast-containing cells to make biofuels. What features of chloroplasts make this possible?
- Sports science: Endurance training increases mitochondria in muscle cells. How does that change energy output and fatigue?

## Common misconceptions and how to avoid them
- “All organelles have membranes.” No—organelles can be membrane-bound (mitochondria, chloroplasts, ER) or non-membranous (ribosomes, cytoskeleton). Ask: Does this job require isolation?
- “Animal cells have nothing rigid.” They lack cell walls, but use cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix for structure. Don’t equate “no wall” with “no support.”
- “Powerhouse” means mitochondria make energy from nothing. They transform energy from food into ATP; energy is conserved. Track inputs and outputs.

## Extension challenges
- Design an experiment (using microscopy or fractionation) to separate and identify ribosomes, mitochondria, and chloroplasts from a mixed cell sample. What properties would you exploit?
- Model how a proton gradient across a membrane can be converted into ATP, using a dam-and-turbine analogy. What leaks or failures would stop ATP production?
- Compare plant, fungal, and bacterial cell walls chemically and mechanically. Predict how each type responds to osmotic stress.

## Reflective insight (the deep “why”)
Cell structures are shaped by the jobs they perform. Membranes create controlled spaces for energy gradients and specialized chemistry; machines that must freely interact with many large molecules stay unenclosed. Plants, making their own food and maintaining turgor, evolved walls and chloroplasts; animals, built for movement and feeding, did not. Once you ask, “What problem is this structure solving?” the presence or absence of membranes, chloroplasts, mitochondria, and cell walls becomes logically inevitable.
