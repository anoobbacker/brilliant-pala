# Answer
## Fast visual reasoning
- Picture a coil and a bar magnet. Push the magnet in and the galvanometer needle twitches; hold it still and the needle rests.
- Only one idea explains a “swirling push” around the loop that appears when magnetism through the loop is changing: changing magnetism stirs an electric swirl around the wire.
- That’s Faraday’s law: changing magnetic pattern through a loop creates a loop‑around push (emf).

So, the correct option is 3. Faraday's law.

### Why not the others?
- Coulomb’s law: straight push between charges, not a loop‑around swirl.
- Kirchhoff’s laws: bookkeeping inside circuits; they don’t create the push, they track it.
- Newton’s laws: motion of masses, not how changing magnetism stirs electricity.

## Typical visual traps
- Thinking a stronger magnet alone causes emf; it’s the change that matters. A strong magnet held still gives no twitch.
- Mixing up “voltage drops add up” (Kirchhoff) with “voltage is created” (induction).
- Believing contact is needed; induction works with no touching—like a moving magnet “dragging” electrons via the changing field.

## Creative twists
- Transformers: a changing magnetic pattern in one coil stirs a push in another nearby coil—no contact.
- Induction cooktops and eddy-current brakes: swirling pushes appear in metal when fields change, heating or slowing motion.
- Bicycle dynamo: spinning magnets keep changing the pattern through coils, so the swirl‑push (emf) keeps being made.

## Build-up from first principles: why Faraday’s law gives induced emf

### 1) Everyday observation: what “induces” means
- If you push water around a closed ring-shaped pipe, water flows. The “push per unit water” is like pressure difference.
- In electricity, the “push per unit charge” around a closed conducting loop is called emf (electromotive force). It is not a force; it is energy per charge gained when going once around the loop.

```math
\text{emf } \mathcal{E} = \text{work done on a unit charge around the loop} \quad (\text{units: Joule/C} = \text{Volt})
```

- Faraday found: you can “push” charges around a loop (create emf) just by changing the magnetic environment near the loop—no battery needed.

### 2) The key experimental facts (Faraday’s experiments)
Move a magnet toward a coil connected to a galvanometer:
- Needle deflects → current exists → there is an emf in the loop.
- Stop moving → needle returns → no emf.
- Move faster → bigger deflection → larger emf.
- Reverse motion/direction → opposite deflection → emf reverses sign.
- Use more turns → bigger deflection → emf scales with number of turns.

These facts suggest:
- The emf depends on how quickly the magnetic situation through the loop changes (rate of change).
- The sign tells you the induced current resists the change (Lenz’s insight).

### 3) How to measure “how much magnetic field passes through the loop”: magnetic flux
We need a single quantity that answers: “How much magnetic field goes through the loop’s area?”
- If the field is uniform and the loop is flat with area A, and its face makes angle θ to the field direction:
  - Maximum “through-ness” when the loop faces the field (θ = 0°).
  - Zero when edge-on (θ = 90°).
- The natural measure is the dot product with the area vector (vector normal to the loop):
  
```math
\Phi_B = \vec B \cdot \vec A = BA \cos\theta
```

- Units: B in tesla (T), A in m² → Φ in weber (Wb). More field, bigger area, or better alignment → larger flux.

### 4) From experiment to law: proportional reasoning and units
From Faraday’s observations:
- Faster change in flux → bigger emf.
- No change in flux → no emf.
- Reverse the change → reverse sign of emf.
- More turns N → emf scales by N.

So the simplest relation is proportional to the rate of change of flux:

```math
\mathcal{E} \propto -\, \frac{d\Phi_B}{dt} \quad \text{and for N turns:} \quad \mathcal{E} \propto -\, N \frac{d\Phi_B}{dt}
```

Why the negative sign? The induced current opposes the change (Lenz’s law) to conserve energy: you must do work to change the magnetic environment against the induced current’s magnetic “reaction.”

Check units to fix the constant:
- Φ has units Wb, dΦ/dt has units Wb/s.
- 1 Wb/s = 1 Volt. So the proportionality constant in SI is 1.

Therefore, the law becomes:

```math
\mathcal{E} = -\, N \frac{d\Phi_B}{dt}
```

This is Faraday’s law. It tells you exactly how to find induced emf in a closed circuit.

### 5) Microscopic “push”: where does the emf come from?
Charges feel forces. Which force is doing the pushing?
- A static magnetic field alone does not do work on stationary charges. But a changing magnetic field creates a curling electric field in space (non-battery electric field).
- That swirling electric field pushes charges around the loop, giving an emf:

```math
\mathcal{E} = \oint \vec E \cdot d\vec \ell = -\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt}
```

This integral form says: the loop integral of the induced electric field equals the negative time-rate of change of magnetic flux through the loop.

### 6) A first-principles check: “motional emf” from the Lorentz force
Consider a straight conductor of length ℓ moving with speed v through a uniform magnetic field B, at right angles to both ℓ and v.
- Mobile charges in the wire feel magnetic force: 
  - Magnitude per charge: F/q = vB (direction given by v × B).
- Charges get separated along the wire, building an electric field E until electric force balances magnetic force: qE = qvB ⇒ E = vB.
- Potential difference across length ℓ is: V = Eℓ = vBℓ.

So the induced emf is:

```math
\mathcal{E} = B \ell v
```

Now notice the swept area rate by the moving rod is dA/dt = ℓv, and the flux change is dΦ/dt = B dA/dt = Bℓv. Therefore:

```math
\mathcal{E} = \frac{d\Phi_B}{dt} \quad \text{(direction set by Lenz’s law gives the minus sign)}
```

This matches Faraday’s law from a direct force-on-charge argument—strong evidence it’s a first-principles result, not a memorized formula.

### 7) Why the other options don’t work
- Coulomb’s law: gives force between stationary charges; says nothing about changing magnetic fields or induced emf.
- Kirchhoff’s laws: useful bookkeeping rules for currents and voltages in circuits. But in circuits with induction, the standard “sum of voltage drops = 0” around a loop must be modified to include the induced emf term from Faraday’s law. Kirchhoff’s laws don’t compute the induced emf; they accept it as a source.
- Newton’s laws: govern motion of masses; not directly about electromotive forces in circuits.

Therefore, the correct way to find induced emf in a closed circuit is Faraday’s law.

## Final result you can use
```math
\mathcal{E} = -\, N \frac{d\Phi_B}{dt}, \quad \Phi_B = \int \vec B \cdot d\vec A \;\; (\text{for uniform } \vec B, \; \Phi_B = BA\cos\theta)
```

## Conceptual follow-up questions
1. If a coil is in a strong magnetic field that is perfectly steady, is any emf induced? Why or why not?
2. You double the area of a loop but rotate it so the angle to the field doubles too. Can the flux stay the same? Predict the induced emf.
3. If the magnetic field decreases inside a loop, what is the direction of the induced current as seen from your side? Explain using “oppose the change.”
4. In a transformer, the primary coil’s current changes with time. Why does the secondary coil get an emf even if the coils don’t touch?

## Application questions
- Bicycle dynamo: Why does pedaling faster make the light brighter? Map each part to dΦ/dt.
- Induction cooktops: How does a changing magnetic field heat a pan without touching it?
- Electric guitar pickups: How does a vibrating ferromagnetic string convert motion into a voltage signal via changing flux?
- Maglev and regenerative braking: How does Lenz’s law enable smooth braking that returns energy to the battery?

## Common misconceptions and traps
- “Magnetic fields push charges directly to produce emf.” Correction: a static magnetic field can deflect moving charges but doesn’t do net work around a closed path. The emf comes from a non-conservative electric field created by a changing magnetic field, or from motion through B that separates charges.
- “Stronger B always means emf.” Correction: no change in flux → no induced emf, even with a huge steady B.
- “Kirchhoff’s loop rule always sums to zero.” Correction: in the presence of induction, you must include the induced emf term; the line integral of the electric field need not be zero.
- “Lenz’s law is arbitrary.” Correction: its minus sign enforces energy conservation; induced currents resist the change so you must supply work.

## Extension challenges
- Derive the induced emf in a rotating loop of area A in a uniform field B: θ = ωt. Find the time-dependent emf and its frequency.
- For a solenoid with N turns, area A, length L, and current I(t), estimate the induced emf in a nearby loop. Relate B inside a solenoid to I and then to Φ and dΦ/dt.
- Design a sensor: You need to detect small changes in magnetic field. How would you increase sensitivity using Faraday’s law? Consider N, A, orientation, and frequency.
- Explore where Kirchhoff’s laws break down: Consider a loop enclosing a time-varying magnetic field but containing no physical source. Write the loop equation including the induced emf.

## Reflective insight: the essence
Faraday’s law says: electric fields can be born from changing magnetic fields, and they swirl in closed loops that can push charges around. The “size” of this swirl is set by how fast the magnetic flux through the loop changes. That deep cause-effect link between changing fields is the heart of electromagnetism—and it’s why moving magnets can light bulbs and changing currents can send power across transformers without contact.
