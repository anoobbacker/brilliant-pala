## Question
Lenz's law is a consequence of conservation of

**Options:**

1. Charge
2. Mass
3. Energy
4. Momentum

## Answer
3. Energy

### Visual reasoning (20-second picture)
- Imagine a coil connected to a tiny bulb. You push a magnet toward the coil.
- If the coil’s induced current helped the magnet’s motion, the magnet would be sucked in for free, the bulb would light, and you wouldn’t need to push. Free light from nowhere.
- That’s impossible. So the induced current must push back against your push. You feel resistance.
- Your effort goes in; the bulb lights or the coil warms. The “push-in” work becomes electrical energy. That’s why the effect always opposes the change: it protects energy bookkeeping.

So Lenz’s law comes from conserving energy.

### Why not the others?
- Charge: nothing is created or destroyed here; charges just circulate.
- Mass: no masses change.
- Momentum: forces appear but are balanced by your hand/supports; the key story is energy flow.

## Typical visual traps
- Thinking “oppose the magnet” instead of “oppose the change.” The coil resists the motion trend, not the magnet’s identity.
- Forgetting the flip: when you pull the magnet out, the coil now tries to keep it in, still resisting the change.
- Imagining free motion with a lit bulb. Spot it: if it moves itself and gives power, that’s a red flag—energy would come from nowhere.

## Creative twists
- Dropping a magnet through a copper tube: it falls slowly and the tube warms. Motion energy turns to heat—opposition guards energy.
- Induction cooktop: changing fields stir currents that resist change and heat the pan.
- Regenerative braking: the motor resists the wheels’ spin and charges the battery—your car “pushes back” to store energy.
