# Question
Two copper wires, one of length 1 m and the other
of length 9 m have the same resistance. The diameters are in the ratio

**Options:**

1. $3: 1$
2. $1: 3$
3. $9: 1$
4. $1: 9$

# Answer
## Fast visual reasoning

- Picture each wire as a road for electrons.
- Making the road 9 times longer makes travel 9 times harder.
- To keep the “difficulty” the same, give the longer road 9 times more lanes.
- Lanes come from the face of the wire (how many tiny straws fit across it). That’s the area.
- How do you get 9 times as many straws? Make the circle’s diameter 3 times bigger: 3 across and 3 up gives a 3-by-3 grid → 9 times as many straws.

So the 9 m wire must be 3 times thicker. Therefore:
- diameters (1 m wire : 9 m wire) = 1 : 3

Answer: 1:3 (Option 2)

## Creative twists
- Mixing up area and diameter: thinking “9 times area means 9 times diameter.” No—tripling diameter gives nine times the circle’s area.
- Getting the order wrong: the longer wire must be the thicker one.
- Forgetting same material: only shape/size matters here, not the metal type.
- Garden hose: a hose 9 times longer needs a much wider hose to keep the same ease of water flow.
- Highways: a detour 9 times longer needs many more lanes to keep traffic moving just as easily.
- Electrical cables: long extension cords use thicker wire to avoid extra resistance—same idea.

## Thinking from first principles

### 1) Everyday intuition: water pipes and traffic lanes
- A longer pipe makes water flow harder (more friction). So “resistance to flow” grows with length.
- A wider pipe lets more water through at once. More lanes, less crowding. So resistance falls when the cross-section is larger.

Electric current in a metal wire behaves similarly:
- Longer wire → electrons collide with more atoms → more “hindrance.”
- Thicker wire → more parallel paths for electrons → less hindrance.

This suggests:
- Resistance R increases with length L.
- Resistance R decreases with cross-sectional area A.

### 2) Turning intuition into proportionality
Let’s capture that as proportionality:
```math
R \propto \frac{L}{A}
```
Different materials hinder electrons differently, so we include a material factor ρ (rho), called resistivity:
```math
R = \rho \,\frac{L}{A}
```
- ρ depends on the material (copper, aluminum, etc.) and temperature.
- For wires made of the same material at the same temperature, ρ is the same.

Dimensional check:
- [R] = ohms (Ω), [L] = m, [A] = m²
- To make units balance, [ρ] must be Ω·m so ρ·(L/A) has units Ω.

### 3) Apply to the problem
We have two copper wires (same ρ), of lengths 1 m and 9 m, with the same resistance R.

Let:
- Wire 1: length L₁ = 1 m, area A₁, diameter d₁
- Wire 2: length L₂ = 9 m, area A₂, diameter d₂

Same resistance means:
```math
\rho\,\frac{L_1}{A_1} = \rho\,\frac{L_2}{A_2}
```
Cancel ρ:
```math
\frac{L_1}{A_1} = \frac{L_2}{A_2}
```
Rearrange:
```math
\frac{A_2}{A_1} = \frac{L_2}{L_1} = \frac{9}{1} = 9
```

For a circular wire, area relates to diameter by:
```math
A = \frac{\pi}{4}\,d^2 \quad\Rightarrow\quad \frac{A_2}{A_1} = \frac{d_2^2}{d_1^2}
```
So:
```math
\frac{d_2^2}{d_1^2} = 9 \quad\Rightarrow\quad \frac{d_2}{d_1} = 3
```

This means the 9 m wire must be 3 times thicker in diameter than the 1 m wire to have the same resistance.

- Ratio of diameters (1 m wire : 9 m wire) = d₁ : d₂ = 1 : 3

Answer: Option 2) 1:3

Note: If the exam intended the ratio in the order (9 m wire : 1 m wire), it would be 3:1. Here we followed the natural order of the statement (1 m first, then 9 m).

## Multiple ways to see why R ∝ L and R ∝ 1/A

- Intuitive collisions model:
  - Double L → electrons travel twice as far → about twice as many collisions → twice the resistance.
  - Double A → it’s like adding a second identical “lane” in parallel; twice as many electrons can pass for the same “push,” so resistance halves.

- Experimental approach:
  - Keep A fixed, measure R for different L. Plot R vs L → straight line through origin. Slope = ρ/A. Similarly, for fixed L, plot R vs 1/A.

## Final result
- The 9 m copper wire must have 9 times the cross-sectional area and thus 3 times the diameter of the 1 m wire.
- Diameter ratio (1 m : 9 m) = 1 : 3.

## Conceptual follow-up questions
1. If both wires had the same diameter, how would their resistances compare? By what factor?
2. If you want a wire twice as long but with the same resistance, by what factor must you change its diameter?
3. If two wires of different materials (ρ₁ ≠ ρ₂) have the same L and A, how do their resistances compare?
4. If temperature rises and ρ increases, what happens to R for a given L and A?

## Application questions
- Why do high-voltage transmission lines use very thick cables for long distances?
- In integrated circuits, why does making interconnects narrower increase resistive heating?
- How do designers choose cable thickness for household wiring to minimize energy loss while keeping costs reasonable?

## Common misconceptions and how to avoid them
- Mistake: “Resistance depends only on length.” Reality: R depends on both L and A (and ρ). Longer → more R; thicker → less R.
- Mistake: “Area and diameter increase by the same factor.” Reality: A ∝ d², so doubling diameter quadruples area.
- Mistake: “Same material means same resistance.” Reality: Only if L/A is the same. Same ρ doesn’t guarantee same R.

## Extension challenges
1. Two wires of the same ρ have equal mass and length ratio 1:4. What is the ratio of their resistances? (Hint: mass ∝ volume ∝ A·L.)
2. A cable is made of N identical thin strands in parallel, each length L and diameter d. Derive the total resistance in terms of N, L, d, and ρ.
3. For a cylindrical wire that tapers linearly from diameter d₁ to d₂ over length L, set up the integral to find its total resistance.

## Reflective insight
The essence: electrical resistance in a wire measures how strongly the material and geometry hinder electron flow. Geometry matters in two simple, opposing ways—longer path means more hindrance; wider path means more simultaneous lanes. This balance crystallizes into R = ρL/A. Once you see that, many design choices in technology become clear: long lines must be thick; thin nanowires heat up; and scaling diameter affects resistance quadratically through area.
