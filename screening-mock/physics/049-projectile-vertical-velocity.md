## Question

**Options:**

1. Average speed is zero, but not average velocity
2. Both average speed and average velocity are zero
3. Average velocity is zero but not average speed
4. Both average speed and velocity depend upon the path

# Answer
## Quick Visual Reasoning
- Picture tossing a ball straight up and catching it back at your hand.
- Draw two ideas:
  - A thin red arrow from where it started to where it ended. Since it ends exactly where it started, that arrow shrinks to nothing. So the “overall push” over the whole trip is zero → average velocity is zero.
  - Now imagine the chalk line the ball traces through the air: up and then down. That path has real length. You spent real time moving along it. So your “pace along the path” isn’t zero → average speed is not zero.

Answer: 3. Average velocity is zero but not average speed.

## Creative twists
- Mixing up path length and net shift:
  - Path length = the chalk trail (up + down), definitely not zero.
  - Net shift = start to finish arrow, which vanishes on a round trip.
- Thinking “stopping at the top” means zero average velocity: the top is just an instant; the whole-trip net shift matters.
- Believing both depend on the path: only the chalk-trail length (speed) cares about the route; the start-to-finish arrow (velocity) does not.
- Running one lap on a track and ending where you began: your fitness watch shows lots of steps (nonzero average speed), but your net location change is zero (average velocity zero).
- An elevator that goes up and returns to the ground floor: motion happened (speed), yet the building lobby is still your final place (velocity zero).
- Drones or delivery robots doing a loop and docking back at base: battery used reflects path length; GPS start equals end means average velocity zero.

## Understanding the problem
A body is thrown straight up and later returns to the same point it was thrown from. We’re asked to compare:
- its average speed and
- its average velocity

and choose the correct statement from the options.

## Everyday starting point: up-and-down elevator trip
Imagine you ride an elevator from the ground floor to the 5th floor, then back to the ground floor.
- Your odometer-like record (how much “ground” you covered) shows a positive distance: up 5 floors + down 5 floors = 10 floors total.
- But your start and finish positions are the same: ground floor. So your net “change of position” is zero.

This is exactly like throwing a ball straight up and catching it where you threw it.

## Reconstructing the basic ideas from first principles

### Position, displacement, and distance
- Position: where you are relative to a chosen origin (e.g., the throw point).
- Displacement: the straight-line “net change” from start to finish. It’s a vector, so direction matters.
- Distance traveled: the total path length you covered, always non-negative.

For a straight up-and-down path:
- If you end where you started, displacement = 0 (because start and finish are the same point).
- But the distance is not zero (you went up some height and came back down).

### Average velocity vs average speed
Ask: “What constant value would reproduce the same overall effect?”

- Average velocity is the constant velocity vector that would take you from start to finish in the same total time. Since velocity connects to displacement,
  

```math
  \vec v_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\Delta \vec r}{\Delta t}
  ```
  
  where $\Delta \vec r$ is displacement and $\Delta t$ is total time.

- Average speed is the constant speed that would cover the same total distance in the same total time:
  

```math
  \text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{total distance}}{\text{total time}}
  ```

Dimensional check for both: meters/second (m/s).

### Applying to “thrown up, returns to same point”
- Displacement over the whole trip: $\Delta \vec r = \vec 0$ (start and end at same point).
- Therefore,
  

```math
  \vec v_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\vec 0}{\Delta t} = \vec 0
  ```
  
  Average velocity is zero.

- Total distance: up some height $h$ and down the same $h$, so
  

```math
  \text{distance} = h + h = 2h > 0
  ```
  
  (We don’t even need to calculate $h$; it’s just positive if the body actually moved.)
- Therefore,
  

```math
  \text{Average speed} = \frac{2h}{\Delta t} > 0
  ```
  
  Average speed is positive, not zero.

So: average velocity = 0, but average speed ≠ 0.

## Multiple viewpoints to strengthen understanding

### 1) Vector vs magnitude reasoning
- Velocity is a vector; “up” and “down” parts can cancel when averaged over time because directions oppose.
- Speed is a magnitude; “up” and “down” both count positively, so they add.

### 2) Integral viewpoint (continuous time)
Let $\vec v(t)$ be the velocity and $v(t)=|\vec v(t)|$ be speed.

- Displacement is the time integral of velocity:
  

```math
  \Delta \vec r = \int_0^T \vec v(t)\,dt
  \quad\Rightarrow\quad
  \vec v_{\text{avg}} = \frac{1}{T}\int_0^T \vec v(t)\,dt
  ```
  
  For up-and-down symmetric motion, the positive and negative parts of $\vec v(t)$ cancel, so $\vec v_{\text{avg}} = \vec 0$.

- Distance is the time integral of speed:
  

```math
  \text{distance} = \int_0^T |\vec v(t)|\,dt
  \quad\Rightarrow\quad
  \text{Average speed} = \frac{1}{T}\int_0^T |\vec v(t)|\,dt > 0
  ```
  
  Magnitudes don’t cancel; they add.

### 3) Experimental idea
Throw a ball straight up:
- GPS-like device tracking your net displacement says 0 at the end.
- A motion tracker that sums path length reports a positive value.
- Stopwatch confirms the total time is positive, so average speed = positive distance / positive time > 0.

## Final answer
Option 3: average velocity is zero but not average speed.

## 1) Conceptual follow-up questions
- If a runner completes a lap on a circular track and stops at the start point, what are their average speed and average velocity? Why?
- Can average velocity be zero even if the object was moving the whole time? Give an example.
- Is the magnitude of average velocity equal to average speed? When do they coincide?
- If the ball is thrown up and caught at a higher balcony instead of the same point, what happens to average velocity and average speed?

## 2) Application questions
- Drones often take off and land at the same pad after surveying an area. Why can their average velocity be zero but their motors still used a lot of energy?
- In delivery logistics, why is total distance (affecting fuel cost) different from net displacement (often unhelpful for cost)?
- For an elevator making many up-and-down trips, how can maintenance schedules depend on total distance traveled rather than displacement?

## 3) Common misconceptions and reasoning traps
- Trap: “Average speed equals the magnitude of average velocity.”  
  Correction: Only true for straight-line motion in a single direction without turning back; otherwise, average velocity depends on displacement, while speed depends on distance.
- Trap: “If initial and final speeds are equal, average speed must be that value.”  
  Correction: Average speed is distance/time, not the arithmetic mean of speeds.
- Trap: “If you return to the start, everything averages to zero.”  
  Correction: Only displacement-based quantities (like average velocity) can cancel to zero; distance-based ones cannot.

## 4) Extension challenges
- A ball is thrown up with initial speed u and returns after time T. Show, using symmetry and constant acceleration, that the time up equals time down, yet average velocity over the full trip is zero and average speed is (total distance)/T. Then compute T and h and find an expression for average speed in terms of u and g.
- Consider non-vertical motion: A hiker goes 3 km east, then 4 km west in the same time for each leg. Compute average speed and average velocity. How do vectors add here?
- Design a simple experiment using a motion sensor to plot v(t) for a tossed ball. Use the area under v(t) to show displacement is zero over the full round trip, while the area under |v(t)| is positive.

## 5) Reflective insight
The essence: Displacement cares about where you end up; distance cares about what you did along the way. Velocity “remembers” direction and can cancel over a round trip; speed does not. That single idea explains why average velocity can be zero while average speed remains positive.
