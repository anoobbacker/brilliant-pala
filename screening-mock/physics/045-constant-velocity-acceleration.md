# Question
When a particle is moving with a constant velocity, its acceleration in $\text{m/s}^2$ is:

---
# Answer
## Start with a real-world picture
Imagine a car on cruise control, moving straight on a flat highway. Its speed doesn’t change, and it isn’t turning. That’s “constant velocity”: same speed and same direction.

Now ask: Is anything trying to change how it’s moving? If not, there’s no “urge” to speed up, slow down, or turn. That “urge” is what acceleration measures.

## Rebuild from fundamentals

- Velocity: how fast and in which direction you move.
- Acceleration: how quickly your velocity changes.

Mathematically, acceleration is the rate of change of velocity:
```math
a = \frac{\Delta \vec{v}}{\Delta t}
```
If velocity is constant, then Δv = 0, so:
```math
a = \frac{0}{\Delta t} = 0 \ \text{m/s}^2
```

Units check: velocity is m/s; change per second gives m/s per s = m/s^2. If there’s no change, it’s 0 m/s^2.

Answer: 0 m/s^2.

## Multiple lenses

- Intuitive view: No change in speed or direction → no “push” needed → zero acceleration.
- Graph view: On a velocity–time graph, constant velocity is a horizontal line; its slope is the acceleration. Flat line → slope 0 → acceleration 0.
- Experimental view: Track position each second. Equal spacing between positions means same velocity; compute differences and you’ll find no change in velocity → acceleration 0.

> ### 🧠 Quick Exam Tips
> - Constant speed is not always constant velocity. If direction changes (like in a turn), velocity changes and acceleration is NOT zero.
> - “Acceleration is slope of v–t graph.” Flat v–t line → a = 0.
> - Newton’s First Law fits: no net force → no change in velocity → a = 0.

## Misconception Clinic
- Many students think: “If speed is constant, acceleration must be zero.” Careful! Only true if direction is also constant. A car going around a circular track at constant speed has acceleration toward the center.
- Another trap: “No forces act when moving at constant velocity.” Actually, forces can act but cancel out (net force = 0), giving a = 0.

## Quick practice
- A cyclist moves east at 6 m/s for 10 s without turning. What is the acceleration? Answer: 0 m/s^2.
- Same cyclist moves at 6 m/s around a curve without changing speed. Is acceleration zero? No—direction changes, so there is acceleration.
