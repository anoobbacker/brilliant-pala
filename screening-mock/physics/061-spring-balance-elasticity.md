## Question
The spring balance does not read properly after its long use because

**Options:**

1. The elasticity of spring increases
2. The elasticity of spring decreases
3. Its plastic power decreases
4. Its plastic power increases

## Core idea
A spring balance measures weight by how much its spring stretches. When it’s new, a certain pull makes a predictable stretch. After long use, the spring doesn’t “snap back” as strongly—its elastic behavior weakens—so the same pull causes more stretch than before. Since the scale was calibrated assuming the original spring strength, it now reads wrong.

Correct option: 2) The elasticity of spring decreases.

## From first principles: why a spring balance works—and why it drifts

### 1) Everyday observation → physical idea
- Pull a fresh rubber band a little: it pulls back. Pull it twice as far: it pulls back roughly twice as hard (for small stretches).
- Old bands feel “softer”: the same pull stretches them more. That “softening” is the loss of elasticity.

A spring balance is just a coiled metal “rubber band.” Its pointer moves because the spring stretches.

### 2) Reconstructing the force–stretch relation without memorized formulas
We want to explain why a balance can label force from how much the spring stretches.

- Suppose a force F stretches a spring by x.
- If we put two identical springs in series (one after another), the same force F must pass through both (they’re in series), and each spring experiences the same force F, so each stretches by x. Total stretch is x + x = 2x.
- If the stretch under F doubles when we double the “length” of spring in series, that suggests stretch is proportional to force for each spring: x ∝ F for small deformations.

This proportionality is the content of Hooke-like behavior (not memorized; derived from additivity and uniformity):
```math
F \propto x \quad \Rightarrow \quad F = k\,x
```
- Here k is the spring’s “stiffness” (spring constant). Large k means a small stretch for the same force; small k means a big stretch.
- Dimensional check: [F] = N, [x] = m, so [k] = N/m.

### 3) How a balance is calibrated
Manufacturers hang known masses m and mark the pointer position.
- The true weight is W = m g (in newtons).
- The spring produces the relation W = k x for those positions.
- The scale is printed assuming that k stays the same forever.

### 4) What long use does to a spring: micro-level intuition
Real metals aren’t perfectly elastic forever. Repeated loading causes:
- Micro-slips and tiny permanent rearrangements in the atomic lattice (plastic deformation).
- Microcracks and fatigue over many cycles.
- The spring takes a “set” (doesn’t fully return) and becomes effectively “softer.”

In simple terms: the spring’s elastic response weakens; its effective stiffness k decreases. That is a decrease in “elasticity.” Plasticity (tendency to deform permanently) effectively increases.

Energy view (adds intuition):
```math
U = \tfrac{1}{2} k x^2
```
- Smaller k means less “energy penalty” for the same stretch, so the spring “objects” less to being stretched—it feels softer.

### 5) Why the reading goes wrong when k decreases
- The scale markings assume old k = k₀. After long use, the real k is smaller (k₁ < k₀).
- For a true weight W, the actual stretch is x_actual = W / k₁ (larger than before).
- The pointer position is converted to a reading using the old calibration W_read = k₀ x_actual, so:
```math
W_{\text{read}} = k_0 \left(\frac{W}{k_1}\right) = \frac{k_0}{k_1}\, W > W
```
So it tends to over-read (and there can also be a zero offset if the spring doesn’t return to zero).

Therefore, the key reason: the spring’s elasticity decreases.

Note on options 3 and 4: “Plastic power” is not a standard term. If it meant “plasticity,” long use usually increases plasticity, but the standard and most precise choice here is option 2: elasticity decreases.

## Final answer
2) The elasticity of spring decreases.

## Conceptual follow-up questions
1. If the spring became stiffer over time (elasticity increased), would the balance over-read or under-read? Explain using F = kx logic.
2. How would a permanent “zero shift” (the pointer not returning to zero with no load) affect readings, even if k stayed the same?
3. Why does the linear relation F ∝ x usually hold only for small stretches? What breaks down for large stretches?

## Application questions
1. Car suspensions “sag” with age. How does decreased elasticity affect ride height and comfort, and how do engineers compensate?
2. In industrial scales, how is periodic recalibration performed to correct for drift in k and zero offset?
3. Athletic shoes lose “bounce” over time. Connect this to changes in effective stiffness and energy return.

## Common misconceptions and reasoning traps
- “If the pointer moves more, the object must weigh more.” Trap: The scale assumes a fixed k. If k decreases, a bigger stretch can be caused by the same true weight.
- “Elasticity means flexible.” Clarification: In physics, higher elasticity means stronger tendency to return (larger k or larger modulus), not simply “more bendy.” A stiffer spring has higher elastic resistance.
- “Old springs just get longer; readings aren’t affected.” Even if you re-zero, a changed slope (k) still corrupts readings unless you recalibrate the scale.

## Extension challenges
1. Experimental: Hang 5 known masses and record stretches on a used spring. Plot F versus x. Is the graph straight? What is the slope? Compare to a new spring.
2. Design: Propose a spring balance with an adjustable cam or variable lever arm that can compensate for a reduced k and restore correct readings.
3. Modeling: If k decays with number of cycles N as k(N) = k₀ e^{-αN}, estimate how often a balance must be recalibrated to keep error below 1%.

## Reflective insight
Measurement devices don’t measure the world directly; they measure a physical effect inside themselves and infer the quantity you care about using a model. A spring balance measures stretch and assumes a stable relation F = kx. When the spring’s elasticity changes, the model (the “mental contract” between physics and instrument) breaks. The deeper lesson: always know the model behind a measurement and watch for drift—then either recalibrate or redesign so your inference remains trustworthy.
