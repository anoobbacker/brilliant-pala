# Answer
- “Turn on” a battery between A and C. The square is perfectly symmetric if you swap B and D. So B and D must rise to the same electrical level.
- If B and D are at the same level, the diagonal between them feels no push. So no current flows through the diagonal at all. It’s as if it isn’t there.
- What’s left? Two identical routes from A to C: A–B–C and A–D–C. Each route is two equal resistors in a row, so each route is like one longer “pipe.”
- Two identical “long pipes” side-by-side share the job equally. Doubling the number of identical paths makes the total opposition half of one path. Since one path is “double a single resistor,” halving brings you back to the opposition of just one resistor.

Answer: A) R

## Creative twists
- Thinking the diagonal must carry current because it’s there. Spot the symmetry: B and D mirror each other when measuring between A and C, so the diagonal is “sleeping.”
- Mixing series and parallel: Each path A–B–C and A–D–C is series (two in a row), but the two paths themselves are parallel (side-by-side between the same endpoints).
- Assuming the diagonal’s value changes the result. Here, any value on B–D does nothing because there’s no voltage difference across it.
- If you replaced the diagonal with a lamp, it wouldn’t light—no push across it. This is the heart of a balanced bridge used in sensors.
- The same idea appears in fluids: two identical canals from Lake A to Lake C at the same height; a side canal connecting midpoints sees no flow if water levels match.
- In other circuits: whenever a network is mirror-symmetric across the line joining the source terminals, the nodes on the mirror line pairs are at equal potential—any link between them carries no current.

## Plan (from first principles)

- Attach a test battery between A and C (say V_A = 1 V, V_C = 0 V).
- Use Ohm’s law and Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL) to determine currents.
- Symmetry suggests B and D will be at the same potential when driving across A and C. We will prove that using KCL (not just intuition).
- If V_B = V_D, then the diagonal BD (2R) has zero voltage across it → zero current → it doesn’t affect the equivalent resistance.
- The network then reduces to two identical series paths (A–B–C and A–D–C) in parallel.

## Method 1: Symmetry + KCL proof (no memorized shortcuts)

Set V_A = 1 V and V_C = 0 V. Let V_B = x and V_D = y (unknowns). Currents are found by Ohm’s law: I = voltage difference / resistance.

Write KCL at B and at D (sum of currents leaving the node = 0):

At B:
```math
\frac{V_B - V_A}{R} + \frac{V_B - V_C}{R} + \frac{V_B - V_D}{2R} = 0
```

At D:
```math
\frac{V_D - V_A}{R} + \frac{V_D - V_C}{R} + \frac{V_D - V_B}{2R} = 0
```

Subtract the second equation from the first:
```math
\frac{(V_B - V_D)}{R} + \frac{(V_B - V_D)}{R} + \frac{(V_B - V_D) - (V_D - V_B)}{2R} = 0
```
Note that (V_B − V_D) − (V_D − V_B) = 2(V_B − V_D). So
```math
\frac{(V_B - V_D)}{R} + \frac{(V_B - V_D)}{R} + \frac{2(V_B - V_D)}{2R} = \frac{3(V_B - V_D)}{R} = 0
```
Therefore:
```math
V_B = V_D
```

Conclusion: B and D are at the same potential. So the diagonal BD has zero voltage across it and carries zero current, regardless of its value (even though it’s 2R here). This is the essence of a balanced bridge. 

With V_B = V_D, the network simplifies to two independent series paths from A to C:
- Path 1: A → B → C has resistance R + R = 2R
- Path 2: A → D → C has resistance R + R = 2R

These two 2R branches are in parallel.

Parallel combination of two equal resistances (derived quickly from first principles):
- Same voltage across both branches; total current equals sum of branch currents.
- If each branch is 2R and the applied voltage is V, each branch current is V/(2R), so total current is 2·V/(2R) = V/R.
- Thus the equivalent resistance is R_eq = V / (V/R) = R.

Answer: R

## Method 2: Direct computation with a 1 V test

With V_A = 1 V, V_C = 0 V, and we found V_B = V_D. Call it V_B = V_D = v.

At B (and similarly at D), since the BD branch has no current when V_B = V_D,
```math
\frac{v - 1}{R} + \frac{v - 0}{R} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2v - 1 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad v = \frac{1}{2}
```

Total current from A:
```math
I_\text{total} = \frac{1 - v}{R} + \frac{1 - v}{R} = \frac{2(1 - 1/2)}{R} = \frac{1}{R}
```
Therefore,
```math
R_\text{eq} = \frac{V}{I} = \frac{1}{1/R} = R
```

This matches Method 1.

## Intuitive mental model (water/heat analogy)

Think of current like water flow and resistors like pipes that resist flow. The setup is symmetric left–right around the diagonal AC. When you push water in at A and draw it out at C equally, the two side branches (through B and through D) are mirror images, so their “midpoints” B and D rise to exactly the same “pressure” (voltage). A pipe connecting two points at the same pressure carries no flow—so the diagonal 2R is inactive. You effectively have two equal, longer paths in parallel, halving the total resistance of a single 2R path → result is R.

---

## Dimensional and proportional reasoning checks

- Resistances in series add because the same current must pass through “more resisting material” (like lengthening a pipe): units stay in ohms.
- Resistances in parallel reduce the total because you add cross-sectional pathways; for two equal paths of 2R, the total conductance doubles, so resistance halves: (2R || 2R) = R.
- Final answer R has units of ohms and lies between one branch (2R) and half of that for two identical branches (R). This fits proportional expectation.

## Real-world connection: Balanced Wheatstone bridge

This is a classic balanced Wheatstone bridge:
- The ratios AB:BC = AD:DC = R:R = 1:1.
- In a balanced bridge, the “bridge” branch (here BD) has zero potential difference and carries no current, regardless of its resistance value.
- This principle is used in precision sensing (strain gauges, temperature sensors) where tiny resistance changes unbalance the bridge and create a measurable voltage across the bridge branch.

## Final answer

A) R

## Ambiguity check (what if there were two R’s in parallel between C and D?)

If the listing “C–D” and “D–C” meant two distinct resistors R in parallel between C and D (making that link R/2), the symmetry would be broken. A quick KCL solution (still from first principles) gives:
```math
R_\text{eq} = \frac{17}{20} R = 0.85\,R
```
which would correspond to “none of these.” However, the standard reading is a single C–D resistor R, leading to R as above.

## Conceptual follow-up questions

1. If the diagonal BD had any resistance X (not just 2R), would the effective resistance between A and C change? Why or why not?
2. If one side resistor is changed (say BC becomes 2R), does current now flow through BD? How does that affect R_eq?
3. What is the effective resistance between adjacent nodes, e.g., between A and B, for the same square with diagonal BD = 2R?
4. If we short B and D (replace BD by a wire), what is R_eq between A and C? Does it change relative to BD = 2R? Explain using equipotential reasoning.

---

## Application questions (modern uses)

- How do strain gauges in a Wheatstone bridge convert tiny changes in length into voltage signals, and why does balancing the bridge help reject noise and temperature drift?
- In PCB or chip design, when is it safe to add a “redundant” link between two nodes that are already equipotential under operation? How does that help or not help current distribution?

---

## Common misconceptions and reasoning traps

- “A diagonal path always changes the resistance.” Not if it connects equipotential nodes in a balanced situation—no voltage difference means no current.
- “You can only simplify series and parallel if there’s a wire junction.” You can also exploit symmetry: if two nodes are guaranteed to be at the same potential for a given two-terminal test, you may treat them as one node for that test (or insert a wire without changing anything).
- “Symmetry is hand-wavy.” You can prove equality of potentials rigorously with KCL/KVL (as shown), or by uniqueness of solutions to linear resistor networks.

---

## Extension challenges

1. Replace the diagonal 2R by a variable xR. Show rigorously that R_eq between A and C remains R for all x, using KCL symmetry.
2. Unbalance a single arm (e.g., make BC = kR). Derive R_eq(AC) as a function of k and determine the current in BD. Identify k that maximizes the bridge current.
3. Use Delta–Star (Δ–Y) transformations to compute R_eq without symmetry, and confirm the same result.
4. Simulate or breadboard the circuit and measure the voltage across BD when you drive A–C; show it is ~0 V when the bridge is balanced, and changes when unbalanced.

## Reflective insight — the deep “why”

Resistor networks are linear and obey uniqueness: given fixed node voltages, there is exactly one distribution of potentials and currents that satisfies Ohm’s law and KCL. When the geometry and boundary conditions are symmetric, the unique solution must inherit that symmetry. Here, driving between A and C with equal side resistors forces B and D to the same potential. Any element connecting equal-potential points is invisible to current flow. Recognizing equipotentials through symmetry is a powerful universal strategy: it lets you simplify complex systems to their essence, even before touching equations.
