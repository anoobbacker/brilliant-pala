# Question
The frequency of a sound wave is 'n' and its velocity is 'v'. If the frequency is increased to 4n, the velocity of the wave will be:  
1) v/4  
2) 2v  
3) 4v  
4) v

# Answer
## Quick visual solution
- Imagine a long row of people doing a “hand-squeeze” relay. The speed at which a squeeze travels down the line is set by how fast each person passes it on — a property of the line itself.
- If the starter sends squeezes four times more often, you don’t make each squeeze travel faster; you just create more squeezes packed closer together.
- Same with sound in the same air: the “message-passing speed” stays fixed by the medium. Increasing frequency just makes the compressions sit closer.
- So the wave’s travel speed doesn’t change.

Answer: 4) v

## Creative twists
- Mixing up how often something happens with how fast it moves: more beats per second doesn’t mean the beat front travels faster.
- Thinking “more frequent” means “more forceful” and therefore faster. Frequency changes spacing of crests, not the medium’s relay speed.
- Confusing crowd density with road speed: more cars per meter gives more cars per second past you, even if the road speed is unchanged.
- Conveyor belt image: The belt speed is fixed. Put boxes closer together and more pass each second, but the belt doesn’t speed up.
- Stadium wave: People stand up in sequence. Start the wave more often → more waves around the stadium, closer together, same seat-to-seat pace.
- Guitar string: Changing note (higher frequency) by shortening the vibrating length packs the wiggles tighter; the ripple speed along the same string stays the same unless the string or its tension changes.

## Intuition First: What actually controls how fast sound moves?

Imagine a row of people passing a hand-squeeze down the line.
- How fast the “message” travels depends on how quickly each person responds and how closely they stand (the medium), not on how often the first person starts squeezing.
- In sound, the “people” are air molecules. The speed of sound depends on the air’s properties (temperature, density, elasticity), not on the pitch (frequency) you produce.

So in a fixed medium (same air conditions), changing the frequency does not change the speed of sound.

## Build the relation from first principles

Ask: How far does a wave “front” move in 1 second?

- Frequency n (or f) = how many wave cycles pass per second.
- Wavelength λ = distance between two crests (or compressions for sound).

In 1 second:
- The wave advances by “number of cycles” × “distance per cycle” = n × λ.

So the speed v (distance per second) must be:
```math
v = n \, \lambda
```

This is not a formula to memorize; it’s just “how many steps per second” times “length of each step.”

## Apply it to the question

Initial: frequency = n, speed = v. So wavelength initially is:
```math
\lambda_1 = \frac{v}{n}
```

Frequency becomes 4n. In the same medium, the speed of sound stays set by the medium. So:
```math
v = (4n)\,\lambda_2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \lambda_2 = \frac{v}{4n} = \frac{\lambda_1}{4}
```

Conclusion: the wavelength shrinks to one-quarter, but the speed v stays the same.

Answer: 4) v

## Experimental view

- Strike a low-pitch and a high-pitch tuning fork at the same place in air. Measure time to reach a microphone a fixed distance away. Times are (essentially) the same.
- What changed? You’d see more wave crests per second (higher frequency), but they’re more tightly packed (shorter wavelength), keeping speed constant.

## Intuitive “what if” checks

- Double frequency? Wavelength halves. Speed unchanged.
- Change the medium (e.g., warm the air)? Speed changes because the medium changed, even if the source frequency stayed the same.

## Misconception Clinic

- Many students think “v = nλ, so if n increases, v must increase.” Actually, v is not controlled by n; it’s controlled by the medium. The product nλ must equal the medium-set speed, so λ adapts when n changes.
- Another common slip: thinking wavelength stays fixed when frequency changes. In one medium, wavelength flexes to keep v constant.

## Extension

- Sound in air (audible range) is essentially non-dispersive: speed doesn’t depend on frequency.
- Some waves (like many water waves or light in certain materials) can be dispersive: speed can depend on frequency. That’s why a prism splits colors.

## Practice questions

1) In the same air, a sound’s frequency is doubled. What happens to its wavelength and speed?
- Answer: Wavelength halves; speed stays the same.

2) A string’s wave speed is fixed by tension and mass per length. If you triple the frequency of the standing wave pattern, what happens to wavelength?
- Answer: It becomes one-third.

3) If air temperature increases, what happens to the speed of sound and the frequency emitted by a fixed source?
- Answer: Speed increases; source frequency stays the same; wavelength increases.
