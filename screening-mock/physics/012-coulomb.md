# Answer
## Start with a real-world picture
Think of charge like money, and each electron is a tiny coin. If one electron carries a "coin" of charge, how many such coins do you need to make 1 coulomb?

Each electron carries a tiny, fixed amount of charge. So total charge is just “number of electrons × charge per electron.” That’s counting, not memorizing.

## Creative twists
- Picture charge like water. One coulomb is a whole bucket of “charge-water.” An electron is a tiny droplet. To fill a bucket, you need an enormous number of identical tiny drops. Mixing up units: thinking a coulomb is one electron. It’s a whole bucket; an electron is a droplet.
- Confusing coulomb (amount of charge) with ampere (flow per second).
- Water analogy: How many drops make a cup? Same idea—cup is the “bucket,” drop is the “electron.”
- Sand analogy: How many grains to make a handful? Grain is the “electron,” handful is the “coulomb.”
- Engineering hint: If one “bucket per second” flows through a thin tube smoothly, each “droplet” must be tiny, so the count per bucket is gigantic—but not so gigantic that the tube must be 100× thicker. This scales your intuition to pick the right exponent and factor.

## Build from first principles

- Physical meaning: 1 coulomb (C) is the total charge that flows when a current of 1 ampere flows for 1 second. It’s a lot of charge.
- Each electron carries the elementary charge (magnitude):

```math
e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19}\ \text{C}
```

- If N electrons together make 1 C, then:

```math
Q = N e \quad \Rightarrow \quad N = \frac{Q}{e} = \frac{1}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}}
```

Compute:

```math
N \approx \frac{1}{1.602} \times 10^{19} \approx 0.624 \times 10^{19} = 6.24 \times 10^{18}
```

Rounding to typical exam precision (using e ≈ 1.6 × 10^-19 C) gives:

```math
N \approx 6.25 \times 10^{18}\ \text{electrons}
```

Note: Electrons have negative charge, but when we ask “how many electrons,” we give a positive count.

Answer: B) 6.25 × 10^18 electrons

### Visual aid (in words)
Imagine a stream of tiny marbles (electrons) passing a line each second. If the stream is 1 A, then 6.24 × 10^18 marbles cross the line every second. That many marbles together make 1 coulomb per second.

## Quick unit/logic check
- Dimensional reasoning: N = Q/e has units C / C = unitless (a count). Good.
- Proportional logic: If each electron’s charge were bigger, you’d need fewer electrons. Since e is tiny, you need a huge number.

## Multiple lenses

### Analytical view
```math
Q = Ne \Rightarrow N = Q/e,\quad Q = 1\ \text{C},\ e \approx 1.6 \times 10^{-19}\ \text{C}
```
So N ≈ 6.25 × 10^18.

### Experimental view
Use a current meter: if a wire carries 1 A for 1 s, a charge of 1 C passes. That corresponds to about 6.25 × 10^18 electrons flowing past any cross-section.

### Intuitive view
- Double the charge → double the number of electrons.
- Half the charge → half the number.
- Linear relationship: N ∝ Q.

## Conceptual follow-ups
- What if Q = 2 C? N ≈ 1.25 × 10^19 electrons.
- What if 5 × 10^18 electrons flow? Q ≈ (5 × 10^18)(1.6 × 10^-19) ≈ 0.8 C.
- Reverse logic: If 3.12 × 10^19 electrons pass, that’s about 5 C.

## Real-life applications
- Smartphone charging: A 2 A current means roughly 1.25 × 10^19 electrons per second entering the battery.
- Static shock: A tiny spark might involve microcoulombs (10^-6 C), still billions of electrons.

## Misconception clinic
- Many students think “1 C = 10^19 electrons exactly.” But it’s about 6.24 × 10^18, not 10^19.
- A common mistake is ignoring the exponent: mixing up 10^18 with 10^19 or 10^20. Remember, e is about 10^-19, so 1/e is about 10^19 times a number less than 1 (≈0.624), giving 10^18 scale.
- Some worry about the negative sign of electrons. The sign tells direction/polarity; the count is positive.

## Extension challenges
- Chemistry link: 1 mole of electrons (Avogadro’s number ≈ 6.022 × 10^23) carries a charge called the Faraday constant:
  F ≈ (6.022 × 10^23)(1.602 × 10^-19 C) ≈ 96485 C.
- Engineering link: Current density—how many electrons flow per second through a tiny area in a wire—connects material properties to heating and power loss.

## Interactive practice
1) How many electrons correspond to 0.2 C?
- N = 0.2 / (1.6 × 10^-19) ≈ 1.25 × 10^18

2) What charge is carried by 3 × 10^17 electrons?
- Q = Ne ≈ (3 × 10^17)(1.6 × 10^-19) = 4.8 × 10^-2 C

3) A current of 0.5 A flows for 4 s. How many electrons passed?
- Q = It = 2 C → N ≈ 2 / (1.6 × 10^-19) ≈ 1.25 × 10^19
