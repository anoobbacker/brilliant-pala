## Question
The frequency of a sound wave is $n$ and its velocity in air is $V$. If the frequency is increased to $4 n$, the velocity of the wave in air will be ' xn '. The value of ' x ' is

## Core idea in plain language
- Think of a “wave” as a moving pattern. For sound in air, it’s a moving pattern of compressions and rarefactions of air.
- The speed of that moving pattern depends on how quickly the medium passes the push along, not on how fast you personally “shake” it.
- In air, the medium’s properties (how stiff it is and how heavy it is) decide the speed. Changing the frequency just changes how closely packed the compressions are (the wavelength), not how fast the pattern moves.

Answer preview: The speed in the same air stays the same. If the initial speed is V, after increasing frequency to 4n, the speed is still V. So x = 1.

Note: The statement “velocity becomes ‘xn’ ” is dimensionally inconsistent (speed cannot be expressed in terms of frequency n alone). The standard form is “speed becomes xV,” with x = 1.

## Step-by-step, from first principles

### 1) Rebuild the relation v = f λ from definitions
- Everyday analogy: Imagine the “stadium wave.” People stand up and sit down one after another. The “crest” of standing people moves around the stadium.
  - Wavelength λ: the seat-to-seat distance between two similar points in the pattern (say, two adjacent “crests”).
  - Frequency f: how many crests pass a fixed seat each second.
  - Speed v: how fast the crest travels along the seats (meters per second).
- In one second, f crests pass you. Each crest is λ meters apart. So the crest travels f × λ meters in one second.
- Therefore, by pure counting and units:
```math
v = f\,\lambda
```
This is not a special formula—it’s just distance per time = (cycles per time) × (distance per cycle).

### 2) What fixes the speed of sound in a given medium?
- Intuition: To send a push quickly, the medium must be
  - “Springy” (stiff) so it pushes back strongly.
  - Not too heavy (low inertia) so it accelerates easily.
- In air, “springiness” is measured by the bulk modulus B (how much pressure rises when you squeeze it). Heaviness is density ρ.
- Dimensional check: Pressure has units N/m²; density is kg/m³. The ratio B/ρ has units
```math
\frac{\text{N/m}^2}{\text{kg/m}^3} = \frac{\text{kg m/s}^2 \cdot \text{m}^3}{\text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2}
= \frac{\text{m}^2}{\text{s}^2}
```
Its square root has units of speed (m/s), so it’s natural that
```math
v = \sqrt{\frac{B}{\rho}}
```
- Causal sketch from Newton’s law:
  - Consider a thin slice of air. If pressure on its left and right are slightly different, there is a net force F = A(p_left − p_right) ≈ −A(∂p/∂x) dx.
  - Its mass is m = ρA dx. So acceleration a = F/m ≈ −(1/ρ)(∂p/∂x).
  - Pressure changes are tied to compression: small compression produces Δp = −B(∂ξ/∂x), where ξ is longitudinal displacement.
  - Combine these with Newton’s second law to get the wave equation
```math
\frac{\partial^2 \xi}{\partial t^2} = \frac{B}{\rho}\,\frac{\partial^2 \xi}{\partial x^2}
```
  - The coefficient tells you the wave speed squared, so v = √(B/ρ).
- Key takeaway: v depends on the medium (B, ρ), not on how quickly you “drive” it (the frequency).

### 3) Put the two ideas together
- Because v is set by the medium, for a given air sample:
```math
v_\text{air} = \sqrt{\frac{B_\text{air}}{\rho_\text{air}}} = \text{constant (for ordinary audible frequencies)}
```
- But v = f λ must also hold. So when you change f, λ adjusts so that v stays the same.
  - If f increases, λ must decrease proportionally.

### 4) Apply to the question
- Initially: frequency = n, speed = V, so wavelength λ = V/n.
- New frequency: 4n. In the same air, the speed remains V.
- New wavelength: λ' = V/(4n) = λ/4.
- Comparing speeds: new speed = V = 1 × V. Hence x = 1.

Final answer: x = 1.

## Multiple viewpoints to deepen understanding

- Analytical: v = √(B/ρ) shows dependence on medium only; f does not appear.
- Counting logic: v = f λ is a definition-level identity. If v is fixed by the medium, f↑ forces λ↓ to keep v constant.
- Experimental: Clap at low pitch or high pitch; the delay to a distant microphone is the same within audible range. Different gases (helium vs carbon dioxide) change B and ρ, and you hear your voice change “speed” and timbre in the gas—evidence that the medium matters.

## Conceptual follow-up questions
1. If you quadruple the frequency of a sound in air, what happens to its wavelength? Why?
2. If you keep the frequency the same but switch from air to helium, what happens to the speed? Explain using B and ρ.
3. A rope wave’s speed depends on tension T and linear density μ as v = √(T/μ). What is the sound-analogue of T and μ in air?
4. If frequency is increased in a dispersive medium (like water waves on deep water), can the wave speed change? Why is air for audible sound approximately non-dispersive?

## Application questions
- Ultrasound imaging: Medical ultrasound uses higher frequencies than audible sound. Why does the image resolution improve with higher frequency, even though the speed in tissue stays nearly the same?
- Instrument design: A flute and a tuba play different pitches. For the same room air, why do both sounds travel to your ears at the same speed?
- Atmospheric science: On a hot day, sound travels faster. Which parameter(s)—B or ρ—change with temperature, and how does that affect v?

## Common misconceptions and how to avoid them
- Trap: “Higher frequency means higher speed.”  
  Correction: In a fixed medium, speed is set by the medium, not by frequency. Frequency changes wavelength, not speed.
- Trap: “v = f λ is a formula to memorize.”  
  Correction: It’s a counting identity: distance per second = cycles per second × distance per cycle.
- Trap: “Dimensions don’t matter.”  
  Correction: Always check units. Expressing speed as “xn” is dimensionally inconsistent unless x has units of length.

## Extension challenges
- Derive, by analogy with sound in air, why a transverse wave on a string has speed v = √(T/μ). Explain the roles of “stiffness” (tension) and “inertia” (mass per length).
- Explore dispersion: For deep-water surface waves, v depends on wavelength. Qualitatively explain why gravity and surface tension introduce wavelength dependence.
- Investigate temperature dependence: Using the ideal gas relation, show that for air v ≈ √(γRT/M). Predict how v changes from 0°C to 30°C.

## Reflective insight
The essence is “clock × step size.” Frequency is the clock (ticks per second). Wavelength is the step size (meters per tick). The medium fixes how fast the pattern can move by balancing stiffness (push-back) against inertia (reluctance to accelerate). Once the medium is chosen, the clock and the step size can trade off, but their product—the speed—stays the same.

Final result: x = 1.
