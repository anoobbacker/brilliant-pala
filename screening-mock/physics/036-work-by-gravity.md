# Question
A mass of 5kg is taken to a depth of 2m. Work done by gravity in joule is $[g = 10 m/s²]$

# Answer
## Quick visual reasoning
- Gravity is a steady downward tug.
- You move the 5 kg mass straight down by 2 m, so the tug and the motion line up—gravity helps, so its work is positive.
- The tug’s strength (given g = 10) on 5 kg is 5×10 = 50 units of pull.
- Letting that same pull act through 2 m gives energy passed on: 50×2 = 100.

Answer: +100 joules

## Creative twists
- Seeing “depth” and thinking the work must be negative. Sign depends on whether motion is with or against gravity. Downward with gravity → positive.
- Forgetting only vertical drop matters; sideways motion wouldn’t change gravity’s work.
- Mixing up “done by gravity” (positive here) with “done by you” if you lower it gently (that would be negative).
- Lift the same mass up 2 m: gravity’s work becomes −100 J; your hand supplies +100 J.
- Water falling 2 m through a turbine: same idea—gravity does positive work on the water, which can be turned into useful energy.
- A roller coaster drop: gravity’s positive work becomes the train’s gain in speed.

## Work done by gravity when lowering a 5 kg mass by 2 m

### Start with an everyday picture
Imagine you’re carrying a backpack down one step. Do you feel gravity helping or resisting? It helps. That “help” is gravity doing positive work because the force (downward) and the motion (also downward) line up.

Let’s apply that idea to moving a 5 kg mass down by 2 m.

### Rebuild from first principles: what is “work”?
Work is “force causing displacement.” In symbols:

```math
W = \vec{F} \cdot \vec{s} = F\,s\,\cos\theta
```

- F is the force size.
- s is how far you move.
- θ is the angle between force and motion.

Here:
- Gravity pulls down with size F = mg.
- The mass is moved down by s = 2 m.
- The angle between force (down) and motion (down) is θ = 0°, so cosθ = 1.

So:

```math
W_\text{gravity} = (mg)(2)\cos 0^\circ = mg \cdot 2
```

Plug in m = 5 kg and g = 10 m/s²:

```math
W_\text{gravity} = 5 \times 10 \times 2 = 100\ \text{J}
```

Sign: positive, because gravity and motion are in the same direction.

### Quick unit (dimension) check
N·m = (kg·m/s²)·m = kg·m²/s² = J. Good.

---

### Energy viewpoint (same conclusion)
Gravitational potential energy decreases when you go down:
```math
\Delta U = m g \Delta h = 5 \times 10 \times (-2) = -100\ \text{J}
```
Work done by gravity is the negative of the change in potential energy:
```math
W_\text{gravity} = -\Delta U = +100\ \text{J}
```

---

### Answer
```math
\boxed{100\ \text{J (positive, by gravity)}}
```

## Visual aid (described)
- Draw a vertical line showing the mass moving downward 2 m.
- Arrow downward labeled “weight, mg.”
- Arrow downward for displacement s.
- Note “θ = 0°, so cosθ = 1 ⇒ positive work.”

> ### 🧠 Quick Exam Tips
> - Gravity does positive work when an object moves down; negative when it moves up.
> - Near Earth’s surface: W_by_gravity = mg × (vertical drop).
> - If the question asks “work done by you while lowering slowly,” it’s the negative of gravity’s work.

## Conceptual follow-ups
- If the same mass is raised by 2 m, what’s W_by_gravity? Answer: −100 J.
- Double the mass or the drop distance? Work doubles (proportional to m and to height change).
- On the Moon (g ≈ 1.6 m/s²), the same drop gives much less work: 5 × 1.6 × 2 = 16 J.

## Experimental view
Drop the 5 kg mass through 2 m from rest. At the bottom:
```math
mgh = \tfrac{1}{2} m v^2 \ \Rightarrow\ v = \sqrt{2gh} = \sqrt{2 \cdot 10 \cdot 2} \approx 6.3\ \text{m/s}
```
The 100 J of gravitational work became 100 J of kinetic energy.

## Misconception clinic
- Many students think “down means negative work.” Actually, sign depends on alignment: force and motion same direction ⇒ positive work.
- A common mistake is mixing “work by gravity” with “work by an external agent.” If you lower slowly, your hand does −100 J while gravity does +100 J.
- “Depth” doesn’t change g over small distances; at 2 m, g is effectively constant.

---

## Extension challenges
- Hydroelectric dams: water drops; gravity does work on water, turning turbines. Power output scales with flow rate and drop height.
- Roller coasters: only vertical height change matters for gravitational work, not the track’s path (conservative force idea).

## Interactive practice
1) A 3 kg box is lifted up 4 m at constant speed. Work done by gravity?
- W = −mg × 4 = −3 × 10 × 4 = −120 J.

2) A 12 kg crate is lowered by 0.5 m. Work done by gravity?
- W = 12 × 10 × 0.5 = 60 J.

3) Which motion gives zero work by gravity?
- Pushing a box 3 m horizontally at constant height. (Force of gravity is vertical; displacement is horizontal ⇒ θ = 90°, cosθ = 0.)

> When a force is conservative (like gravity), only “where you start and where you end” in the vertical matters for work—path details don’t. Nature loves bookkeeping through energy. Understanding direction and alignment turns sign confusion into clarity.
