# Question
How much force is required to lift a mass of $100$ g

---
# Answer
## Quick visual answer (Earth)
- Picture a tug‑of‑war: gravity pulls the 100 g mass down; to just lift it, your upward pull must match that pull exactly.
- A 100 g object feels like a small apple. On a spring scale, that pull lines up to about one “push” unit called a newton.
- So the gentle upward force you need is about 1 newton. If you want it to rise faster, you’d pull a bit more; to hover or rise very gently, about 1 newton is enough.

Answer: about 1 newton upward

## Creative twists
- Mixing mass and force: grams measure “how much stuff,” but the needed lift is a pull (newtons). Look for “how hard you must pull,” not “how much stuff.”
- Thinking you need more force to keep it moving at steady speed: once it’s moving steadily, matching gravity is enough; extra pull only speeds it up.
- Forgetting the setting: this “about 1 newton” is for Earth; weaker gravity needs less pull, stronger gravity needs more.
- Elevators and drones: When they lift off, thrust just matches weight; to speed up, they push a bit harder, then ease back to match.
- Nature: A bird hovering matches its weight with wing lift; to climb, it flaps harder; to glide level, it balances forces again.
- Different worlds: On the Moon the same 100 g object would need noticeably less pull to lift; on a massive planet, noticeably more.

## Think first: What does “lift” really mean?

If you hold a 100 g object (about a small apple), Earth’s gravity pulls it down. To make it rise without speeding up or slowing down, your upward force must exactly balance that pull. That pull is its weight.

Answer (on Earth):
- Convert mass: 100 g = 0.100 kg
- Gravitational field strength: g ≈ 9.8 N/kg (often rounded to 10 N/kg for quick estimates)
- Weight = force needed to just lift at constant speed = m × g = 0.100 × 9.8 ≈ 0.98 N
- Quick estimate: ≈ 1.0 N if you use g = 10 N/kg

Why this makes sense (from first principles):
- Gravity provides a downward force mg.
- Newton’s second law says net force = mass × acceleration.
- To lift at constant speed (acceleration = 0), net force must be zero: Upward force − mg = 0 → Upward force = mg.

If you want it to accelerate upward:
- You need a bit more than its weight: Fup = m(g + a)
- Example: accelerate upward at 2 m/s² → F = 0.100 × (9.8 + 2.0) ≈ 1.18 N

Thinking tools:
- Dimensional check: kg × m/s² = N (newtons) — correct.
- Proportional logic: double the mass → double the needed lifting force.
- Intuition: If you push harder than weight, it speeds up upward; if you push less, it slows or goes down.

Multiple lenses:
- Analytical: F = mg for constant speed; F = m(g + a) for upward acceleration a.
- Experimental: Hang the mass from a spring scale and pull up until it just rises; it will read about 1 N.
- Intuitive: On the Moon (g ≈ 1.6 N/kg), the same 0.100 kg mass needs only ~0.16 N to lift.

Quick exam tips:
- Always convert grams to kilograms.
- “Just lift” or “constant speed” means force equals weight (mg).
- Use g = 9.8 N/kg unless told to use 10 N/kg for estimates.

Misconception clinic:
- “Many students think 100 g needs 100 N.” Not true. 100 g is mass, not force. Weight is mg ≈ 1 N.
- “You must always pull more than weight to lift.” Only if you want upward acceleration. For steady upward motion, equal to weight is enough.

Try these (mental practice):
1) What force is needed to lift 250 g at constant speed? (Answer: 0.250 × 9.8 ≈ 2.45 N; ≈ 2.5 N with g = 10)
2) To accelerate a 0.50 kg book upward at 1.5 m/s², what force is needed? (F = 0.50 × (9.8 + 1.5) ≈ 5.65 N)
3) On Mars (g ≈ 3.7 N/kg), what force lifts 100 g at constant speed? (≈ 0.37 N)

Reflective essence:
- Nature’s rule is about changes: you need extra force only to change motion. Balance the opposing pull (weight) to hold or move steadily; apply more to speed up, less to slow down.
