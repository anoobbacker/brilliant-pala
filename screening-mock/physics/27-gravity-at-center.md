# Question
The value of g on earth surface is 9.8 m/s². Then the value of g at earth's centre in m/s² is:  
1) 9.8  
2) 19.6  
3) 4.9  
4) zero


## Start with a real-life picture

Imagine you’re at the exact center of a huge, perfectly round crowd. Everyone around you pulls your sleeves gently with equal strength from all directions—front, back, left, right, up, down. What happens to you? You don’t move, because all the pulls cancel out.

That’s exactly what happens to gravity at the Earth’s center: every bit of rock pulls you, but the pulls from opposite sides balance perfectly. So the net gravitational pull (and therefore g) at the very center is zero.

Correct option: 4) zero

## Rebuilding from first principles

### Step 1: What creates “g”?
Gravitational acceleration g at a point is just how strongly Earth pulls per kilogram at that point. Outside a spherical planet, we often use:
```math
g = \frac{GM}{r^2}
```
where r is your distance from the center.

But that formula only applies outside the sphere. Inside the Earth, the mass “above you” isn’t all below your feet—it surrounds you. So we need to think more carefully.

### Step 2: The shell idea (symmetry logic)
- A thin spherical shell (like a hollow ball) pulls with zero net force on anything inside it. Why? For every small patch of mass pulling you one way, there’s a patch on the opposite side that pulls the other way; the geometry and inverse-square law balance perfectly.
- A solid sphere can be imagined as many nested shells.

So if you stand at some distance r from the center inside Earth:
- All the shells outside your radius contribute zero net force (by the shell idea).
- Only the mass inside radius r matters. That inner mass acts as if it were concentrated at the center.

### Step 3: Proportional reasoning inside the Earth
Assume uniform density ρ to see the pattern (the conclusion at the center holds even if density isn’t uniform).

- Mass enclosed within radius r:
```math
M_{\text{enclosed}} = \rho \cdot \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3
```
- Gravitational acceleration at radius r (due to that enclosed mass):
```math
g(r) = \frac{G M_{\text{enclosed}}}{r^2}
     = \frac{G \left(\rho \cdot \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\right)}{r^2}
     = \frac{4}{3}\pi G \rho \, r
```
So inside a uniform sphere, g is directly proportional to r. That means:
- At the surface (r = R), you get the usual surface g.
- At the center (r = 0), you get:
```math
g(0) = 0
```

Even if Earth’s density isn’t uniform, symmetry guarantees g = 0 at the center because all directions pull equally.

## Visual aid (in words)

Picture arrows pointing towards you from every direction inside a sphere. At the very center, the arrows are equally strong in all directions, so when you add them up like vectors, they cancel to zero. As you move away from the center, the cancellation isn’t perfect, so a net arrow (acceleration) appears pointing toward the center.

## Experimental view

If you could fall through a frictionless straight tunnel through Earth:
- You’d speed up on the way to the center (gravity pulls you toward the center).
- At the exact center, your speed would be maximum, but your acceleration would be zero at that instant (no net pull either way).
- You’d then slow down symmetrically heading to the other side.

## Intuitive “what if” checks

- If you’re halfway to the center in a uniform Earth, g is about half the surface value (because g ∝ r).
- At the center (r = 0), g must be zero—no preferred direction to pull you.

> ### 🧠 Quick Exam Tips
> - Inside a spherical planet, only the mass closer to the center than you contributes to g.
> - g inside a uniform sphere: g ∝ r; at the center, g = 0.
> - Don’t use g = GM/r² inside the Earth. That formula is only for outside.
> - Symmetry is your friend: at the center, all pulls cancel.

## Misconception clinic

- Many students think “you’re closer to more mass at the center, so g should be largest there.” But actually, pulls from all sides cancel perfectly at the center. More mass around you doesn’t mean a net direction.
- A common mistake is assuming g = GM/r² everywhere. That formula is valid outside a spherically symmetric mass. Inside, you must consider only the enclosed mass, leading to g ∝ r (for uniform density).

## Extension links

- Same pattern appears in electricity: the electric field inside a uniformly charged solid sphere increases linearly with r and is zero at the center; inside a thin spherical shell it’s zero everywhere.
- Engineering analogy: forces balance at the geometric center in symmetric structures—symmetry often implies zero net effect at the center.

> Nature loves symmetry. When there’s no preferred direction—like at the exact center of a sphere—the net push must vanish. Recognizing symmetry quickly is a superpower that turns complex problems into simple truths.
