## Question

The value of $\frac{\sqrt{0.027}}{\sqrt{0.008}} + \frac{\sqrt{0.09}}{\sqrt{0.04}} - 1$

## Square Root Expression — Solved from First Principles

We want the value of:
```math
\frac{\sqrt{0.027}}{\sqrt{0.008}} + \frac{\sqrt{0.09}}{\sqrt{0.04}} - 1
```

### Big picture intuition (before any formulas)
- A square root answers the question: “What side length gives this area?” For example, if a square has area 9 m², its side is √9 = 3 m.
- Ratios of square roots naturally relate to ratios of areas. If one square has area A and another has area B, the ratio of their side lengths is √A / √B = √(A/B). That’s because scaling area by a factor k scales the side by √k.

We’ll use that idea to simplify each fraction of square roots.

## Step 1: Why can we combine the square roots?
Let $a>0$ and $b>0$. Let $s=\sqrt{a}$ and $t=\sqrt{b}$. By definition, $s^2=a$ and $t^2=b$, and $s,t>0$.

Consider the ratio $s/t$:
```math
\left(\frac{s}{t}\right)^2 = \frac{s^2}{t^2} = \frac{a}{b}.
```
The positive number whose square is $a/b$ is $\sqrt{a/b}$. Since $s/t>0$, we must have:
```math
\frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}} = \sqrt{\frac{a}{b}} \quad \text{(for } a,b>0\text{)}.
```
We’ll use this to turn each fraction under square roots into a single square root.

## Step 2: Convert decimals to clean fractions
Decimals like 0.027 and 0.008 are awkward, but they’re just fractions:
- $0.027 = \frac{27}{1000}$
- $0.008 = \frac{8}{1000}$
- $0.09 = \frac{9}{100}$
- $0.04 = \frac{4}{100}$

This will make ratios simpler because common denominators cancel.

## Step 3: Simplify the first term
Start with:
```math
\frac{\sqrt{0.027}}{\sqrt{0.008}}
= \sqrt{\frac{0.027}{0.008}}
= \sqrt{\frac{\frac{27}{1000}}{\frac{8}{1000}}}
= \sqrt{\frac{27}{8}}.
```
Now factor out perfect squares to simplify the square root:
- $27 = 9 \cdot 3$
- $8 = 4 \cdot 2$

So:
```math
\sqrt{\frac{27}{8}}
= \sqrt{\frac{9\cdot 3}{4\cdot 2}}
= \sqrt{\frac{9}{4}}\cdot \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}
= \frac{3}{2}\,\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}.
```
You can also rewrite $\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}$ neatly:
```math
\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{6}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{6}}{2}.
```
So the first term becomes:
```math
\frac{3}{2}\cdot \frac{\sqrt{6}}{2} = \frac{3\sqrt{6}}{4}.
```

---

## Step 4: Simplify the second term
```math
\frac{\sqrt{0.09}}{\sqrt{0.04}}
= \sqrt{\frac{0.09}{0.04}}
= \sqrt{\frac{\frac{9}{100}}{\frac{4}{100}}}
= \sqrt{\frac{9}{4}}
= \frac{3}{2}.
```

---

## Step 5: Put it all together
The whole expression is:
```math
\frac{3\sqrt{6}}{4} + \frac{3}{2} - 1
= \frac{3\sqrt{6}}{4} + \frac{1}{2}
= \frac{3\sqrt{6} + 2}{4}.
```

As a quick numerical check: $\sqrt{6}\approx 2.449$, so
```math
\frac{3\sqrt{6}+2}{4} \approx \frac{3(2.449)+2}{4} = \frac{9.347}{4} \approx 2.33675,
```
which matches the intuition that the first term is a bit under 2 and the second term contributes +0.5.

Final exact value:
```math
\boxed{\frac{3\sqrt{6}+2}{4}}
```

## Multiple ways to see it (flexible thinking)
- Analytical: Combine roots using $\sqrt{a}/\sqrt{b}=\sqrt{a/b}$, convert decimals to fractions, factor perfect squares.
- Intuitive geometry: Think of each decimal as a square’s area. The ratio of side lengths equals the square root of the ratio of areas; extract the neat parts (like $9/4$) whose square roots are clean.

## 1) Conceptual follow-up questions
- If two square tiles have areas $A$ and $B$, why is the ratio of their side lengths $\sqrt{A/B}$ and not $A/B$?
- If $0.027$ were replaced by $k\cdot 0.008$, what would $\sqrt{0.027}/\sqrt{0.008}$ become in terms of $k$?
- Why does $\sqrt{a}/\sqrt{b}=\sqrt{a/b}$ require $a,b>0$? What goes wrong if $b=0$ or if negatives are allowed?
- If you scale an area by a factor of 100, by what factor does its side length change, and why?

## 2) Application questions (real-world links)
- Imaging: If one camera sensor has area 27 mm² and another 8 mm², how do typical noise levels or light capture per pixel relate to side lengths (which scale with $\sqrt{27/8}$)?
- Mapping: If a map’s area scale is increased by a factor of 9, how does the scale bar length change?
- Materials: A square metal plate’s heat dissipation perimeter scales with side length, but heat capacity scales with area. How would changing area by a factor change the side length and the perimeter?

## 3) Common misconceptions and how to avoid them
- Trap: Thinking $\sqrt{a}/\sqrt{b} = \sqrt{a}/b$. Fix: Always combine inside the root first: $\sqrt{a}/\sqrt{b}=\sqrt{a/b}$ (for $b>0$).
- Trap: Taking square roots of sums termwise: $\sqrt{a+b}\neq \sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b}$ in general.
- Trap: Forgetting to simplify square roots by pulling out perfect square factors (e.g., $27=9\cdot 3$) to get cleaner forms.
- Trap: Mishandling decimals. Convert to fractions early to avoid place-value mistakes.

## 4) Extension challenges
- Generalize: Simplify $\sqrt{a\times 10^m}/\sqrt{b\times 10^m}$ and explain why the $10^m$ cancels.
- Symbolic: For positive $x,y$, express $\sqrt{\frac{9x}{4y}}$ in the simplest exact form.
- Geometry lab: Cut paper squares of areas in ratio $27:8$. Measure side lengths and verify the ratio is $\sqrt{27/8}$.
- Beyond squares: For volumes of cubes $V_1$ and $V_2$, what is the ratio of edge lengths? Connect to cube roots and the “square-cube law.”

## 5) Reflective insight (the deep “why”)
Square roots translate “area-scale” into “length-scale.” When you divide or multiply areas, the side lengths respond by the square root of that change. That’s why ratios of square roots collapse into the square root of a ratio, and why pulling out perfect square factors makes expressions elegantly simple. Understanding this bridge between area and length lets you navigate any square-root expression with confidence.
