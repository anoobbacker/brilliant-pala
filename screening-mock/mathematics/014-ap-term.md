## Question

Which term of the arithmetic progression $8,\ 14,\ 20,\ 26,\ \ldots$ will be $72$ more than its $41^\text{st}$ term?

**Options:**
- A) $43^\text{rd}$
- B) $53^\text{rd}$
- C) $63^\text{rd}$
- D) $68^\text{th}$

## Think of it like climbing stairs
- The numbers 8, 14, 20, 26, ... go up by the same amount each time: +6.
- That’s like a staircase where every step is 6 units high.
- The “41st term” is like the 41st step.
- The question asks: Which step is 72 units higher than the 41st step?

If every step is +6, then:
- Gaining +72 means taking enough steps so that “number of steps × 6 = 72”.

```math
\text{steps needed} = \frac{72}{6} = 12
```

So we must go 12 steps ahead of the 41st term:
```math
\text{required term} = 41 + 12 = 53
```

Answer: 53rd term. Option B.

## Why this works (built from first principles)

### 1) Constant step idea → linear change
- In an arithmetic progression (AP), the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Here, that constant is 6.
- Let’s call the nth term T(n). Then:
```math
T(n+1) - T(n) = d \quad\text{(a constant)},\ \text{here } d = 6
```
- If you move from the mth term to the kth term, you take (k − m) steps.
- Each step adds d, so the total change is:
```math
T(k) - T(m) = (k - m)\,d
```
This is just repeated addition—no memorized formula, only counting equal steps.

Now apply it to the question: “Which term is 72 more than the 41st term?”
- That means T(k) − T(41) = 72.
- Using the relation above:
```math
(k - 41)\,d = 72
\Rightarrow (k - 41)\cdot 6 = 72
\Rightarrow k - 41 = 12
\Rightarrow k = 53
```

Dimensional intuition:
- d has “value per term” units (here, +6 per step).
- (k − m) has “term” units (number of steps).
- Their product gives “value” units, matching the 72 difference. It’s like distance = speed × time.

### 2) Alternate route: rebuild the nth-term expression
Start from the first term a1 = 8. Each step adds d = 6. After (n − 1) steps, you reach:
```math
T(n) = a_1 + (n - 1)\,d = 8 + (n - 1)\cdot 6
```
- First, compute the 41st term to check:
```math
T(41) = 8 + 40\cdot 6 = 8 + 240 = 248
```
- “72 more than the 41st” is 248 + 72 = 320.
- Find n such that T(n) = 320:
```math
8 + (n - 1)\cdot 6 = 320
(n - 1)\cdot 6 = 312
n - 1 = 52
n = 53
```
Same result.

### Quick numerical check
```math
T(53) = 8 + 52\cdot 6 = 8 + 312 = 320
T(53) - T(41) = 320 - 248 = 72
```

Final: 53rd term (Option B).

## 1) Conceptual follow-up questions
- If each term increases by 6, which term is 48 less than the 41st term?
  - 48/6 = 8 steps backward → 41 − 8 = 33rd term.
- If a sequence starts at 5 and goes up by 3, which term is 60 more than the 20th term?
  - 60/3 = 20 steps forward → 20 + 20 = 40th term.
- If T(k) is 90 more than T(10) and the common difference is 5, what is k?
  - (k − 10)·5 = 90 → k − 10 = 18 → k = 28.
- Reverse logic: If T(k) is 15 less than T(50) and d = 3, what is k?
  - (k − 50)·3 = −15 → k − 50 = −5 → k = 45.

## 2) Applications to real life and engineering
- Train schedules: If trains depart every 6 minutes, the departure 72 minutes after the 41st is the 53rd departure.
- Manufacturing: Items on a conveyor spaced by 6 cm—find which item is 72 cm ahead of the 41st item → the 53rd item.
- Digital audio: Samples spaced regularly in time; to get a fixed time increment, you move a fixed number of samples ahead.
- Finance: Regular deposits of a fixed amount; to increase the balance by a target amount, count how many deposit intervals you need.

## 3) Common misconceptions and traps
- Mixing up count and value: 72 is a value difference, not a term count. You must divide by the common difference (6) to convert to “number of steps.”
- Off-by-one errors: Remember the 1st term is not the 0th term. T(n) = a1 + (n − 1)d, not nd.
- Wrong direction sign: “More than” means forward; “less than” means backward.
- Using a formula without understanding: Focus on “constant step size → linear change,” then everything follows.

## 4) Extension challenges
- Generalize: For any AP with difference d, the term that is Δ more than T(m) is T(m + Δ/d). When does this fail? (When Δ is not a multiple of d for integer-indexed terms.)
- Unknown difference: Given T(5) = 41 and T(12) = 90, find d and then the term that’s 72 more than T(41).
  - d = (90 − 41)/(12 − 5) = 49/7 = 7. Then steps = 72/7 (not an integer), discuss implications.
- Graph view: Plot T(n) versus n. Show it’s a straight line with slope d. Interpret k from vertical difference 72 as a horizontal shift 72/d.
- Physics analogy: Uniform motion s = ut + at^2/2 with a = 0 (constant speed). Here “speed” = d per term and “time” = number of steps.

## 5) Reflective insight — the essence
An arithmetic progression is just “constant change per step.” Because each move adds the same amount, total change is directly proportional to the number of steps. That’s why to get a specific increase (like +72), you simply count how many equal increments fit into it (72/6), then shift that many terms. This “change = rate × steps” principle is the backbone of linear thinking across math, physics, and engineering.
