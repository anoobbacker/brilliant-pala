## Question

If in a fraction, 1 less from two times the numerator ($x$) and 1 added to the denominator ($y$), then the new fraction is $\frac{2x - 1}{y + 1}$. The original fraction is:

**Options:**
- A) $\frac{x}{y}$
- B) $\frac{2x}{y}$
- C) $\frac{x}{2y}$
- D) $\frac{x}{y - 1}$
- E) None of these

## Understand the story (everyday intuition)

Think of a recipe: you have a certain number of cups of sugar (numerator) over a certain number of cups of flour (denominator) — that’s your original “fraction.” Now someone tells you to:
- Double the sugar and then remove 1 cup.
- Add 1 cup to the flour.

That gives you a new recipe (a new fraction). The problem tells us this new fraction looks like:
- New numerator: 2x − 1
- New denominator: y + 1
So the new fraction is (2x − 1)/(y + 1).

What was the original fraction?

## Build from first principles (no memorized formulas)

### Step 1: Name the original fraction
Let the original fraction be:
```math
\text{Original fraction} = \frac{N}{D}
```
Here, N is the original numerator and D is the original denominator.

### Step 2: Apply the “recipe change” literally
The instruction says:
- “Two times the numerator, then 1 less” → new numerator = 2N − 1
- “Add 1 to the denominator” → new denominator = D + 1

So the new fraction must be:
```math
\text{New fraction} = \frac{2N - 1}{D + 1}
```

### Step 3: Match with what the problem gives
The problem states that the new fraction is:
```math
\frac{2x - 1}{y + 1}
```
Comparing the structure:
- The “thing that got doubled then subtracted by 1” is N, and the result is written as 2x − 1. That tells us N must be x.
- The “thing that had 1 added” is D, and the result is written as y + 1. That tells us D must be y.

Therefore, the original fraction was:
```math
\frac{N}{D} = \frac{x}{y}
```

### Step 4: Inverse-thinking check (undo the steps)
Another way: If the new numerator is 2x − 1, what original numerator would produce that after “double then subtract 1”? Undo it:
- Add 1 back: (2x − 1) + 1 = 2x
- Halve it: 2x / 2 = x

If the new denominator is y + 1, undo “add 1”:
- Subtract 1: (y + 1) − 1 = y

So original = x/y. This confirms the result.

### Step 5: Quick numerical sanity check
Pick x = 3, y = 4.
- Original (guess): x/y = 3/4.
- Apply the rule: double numerator and minus 1 → 2·3 − 1 = 5; add 1 to denominator → 4 + 1 = 5. New = 5/5 = 1.
- Given expression: (2x − 1)/(y + 1) = (6 − 1)/(4 + 1) = 5/5 = 1. Matches perfectly.

## Choose the correct option
- A) x/y ← Correct
- B) 2x/y → Would produce (4x − 1)/(y + 1), not matching.
- C) x/(2y) → Would produce (2x − 1)/(2y + 1), not matching.
- D) x/(y − 1) → Would produce (2x − 1)/y, not matching.

Final answer: A) x/y.

## 1) Conceptual follow-up questions
- If the new fraction were (3x + 2)/(y − 5), what operation was done to the numerator and denominator?
- If after the change you see (2N − 1)/(D + 1), how would you recover N and D from the new numerator and denominator in general?
- If the new fraction equals the old fraction (i.e., transformation leaves it unchanged), what equations must N and D satisfy?

## 2) Applications to real life and science
- Recipe scaling: If a chef doubles a component and then adjusts by a fixed amount (like “2 scoops minus 1”), how do you reconstruct the original proportions?
- Sensor calibration: A device might report a transformed value like 2T − 1 from a true temperature T. How do engineers retrieve T from the reading?
- Data normalization: Adding a constant to a denominator (like total population + 1) is used to avoid division by zero in algorithms. How does this change ratios and how do you reverse it?

## 3) Common misconceptions and traps
- Mixing up “do” and “undo”: Some might think to use x/(y − 1) because they try to “undo” only the denominator change, forgetting the numerator rule must match too.
- Doubling the whole fraction: Choosing 2x/y or x/(2y) assumes only one side was modified. The rule applies separately to numerator and denominator.
- Ignoring structure: The specific form (2x − 1)/(y + 1) encodes exactly what was done. If your supposed original doesn’t reverse to x and y, it’s wrong.

## 4) Extension challenges
- Generalize the operation: Suppose the rule is “multiply numerator by a and add b; multiply denominator by c and add d.” If the new fraction is (aN + b)/(cD + d), derive formulas to recover N and D from the new numerator and denominator.
- Fixed points: For what fractions N/D does the transformation (2N − 1)/(D + 1) equal N/D itself? Solve for such N and D (think proportional equations).
- Composition: Apply the rule twice. What is the result of doing “double minus 1; add 1” twice in a row? Can you write the final fraction in terms of the original N and D?

## 5) Reflective insight (the deep “why”)
This problem is about thinking of operations on a fraction as a clear, step-by-step mapping: inputs (N, D) → outputs (2N − 1, D + 1). Once you see it as a function, reversing it or matching patterns becomes straightforward. The essence is structural thinking: read the transformation as instructions that encode exactly how the original parts must have looked. When you focus on structure, not surface symbols, unfamiliar problems become simple.
