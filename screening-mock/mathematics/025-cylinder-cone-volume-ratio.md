## Question

The radii of the bases of a cylinder and a cone
are in the ratio $3: 4$ and their heighs are in the ratio $2: 3$. Then, their
volumes are in the ratio

**Options:**

1. $9: 8$
2. $8: 9$
3. $3: 4$
4. $4: 3$

## Big idea in everyday terms

- Imagine stacking identical round coins into a neat column. The “space” (volume) you get is just “how much area one coin covers” times “how tall the stack is.”
- A cylinder is exactly that: a stack of identical circular slices. So its volume grows directly with:
  - how big the circular base is (depends on radius squared), and
  - how tall the cylinder is.
- A cone is like a party hat: as you go up, each circular slice gets smaller, shrinking steadily to a point. It turns out that three cones of the same base and height fill the matching cylinder exactly. So a cone’s volume is one-third of that cylinder’s.

We will rebuild these facts from first principles and then use them to get the ratio asked.

## Rebuilding the formulas from scratch

### 1) Why cylinder volume = base area × height

- Think in layers: if you add a 1 cm thick layer on top of a shape whose cross-section doesn’t change with height, the added volume equals its cross-sectional area times 1 cm.
- A cylinder has the same circular cross-section at every height. So:
  
```math
V_{\text{cyl}} = (\text{area of base}) \times (\text{height})
```

- The area of a circle grows with the square of its radius because lengths scale one way, areas scale as length squared. The constant of proportionality for a circle is π, so base area = πr². Therefore:

```math
V_{\text{cyl}} = \pi r^2 h
```

(Dimensional check: r²h has units of length³, i.e., volume—good.)

### 2) Why cone volume = one-third of the matching cylinder

There are two complementary ways to see this:

- Experimental intuition: Fill a cone (party hat) with sand or rice and pour it into a cylinder that has the same base radius and the same height. You must pour three cones to fill one cylinder. This repeatable experiment shows:
  
```math
V_{\text{cone}} = \frac{1}{3} \times (\text{base area}) \times (\text{height})
               = \frac{1}{3}\pi r^2 h
```

- Logical intuition (slices and shrinking): A cone’s circular slices shrink linearly with height (the radius goes from r at the base to 0 at the tip in a straight-line way). Because area depends on radius squared, the areas of slices follow a “square of a line” pattern. Averaging those squared sizes over the height turns out to be one-third of the maximum area—matching the experimental result.

## Apply to the given ratios

We are told:
- Radii (cylinder : cone) = 3 : 4
- Heights (cylinder : cone) = 2 : 3

Let:
- Cylinder radius = 3x, cone radius = 4x
- Cylinder height = 2y, cone height = 3y

Compute the volumes (using the derived forms):

```math
V_{\text{cyl}} = \pi (3x)^2 (2y) = \pi \cdot 9x^2 \cdot 2y = 18\pi x^2 y
```

```math
V_{\text{cone}} = \frac{1}{3}\pi (4x)^2 (3y)
               = \frac{1}{3}\pi \cdot 16x^2 \cdot 3y
               = 16\pi x^2 y
```

Now take the ratio:

```math
V_{\text{cyl}} : V_{\text{cone}} 
= 18\pi x^2 y : 16\pi x^2 y
= 18 : 16
= 9 : 8
```

Answer: 9 : 8 (Option 1)

Note how π and the placeholders x, y cancel—so the ratio depends only on the given radius and height ratios.

## Multiple viewpoints (to build flexible thinking)

- Dimensional analysis: For any “prism-like” shape (constant cross-section), volume must be proportional to area × height, hence r²h. The cylinder’s constant is π. For the cone, experiment (or slice-averaging) gives an extra factor of 1/3.
- Scaling intuition: If you scale radius by a and height by b, a cylinder’s volume scales by a²b; a cone’s also scales by a²b but with the fixed 1/3 factor. Ratios thus often reduce to comparing a²b with a²b/3 times other constants.

## Conceptual follow-up questions

1. If two cylinders have radii in ratio 1:2 but the same height, what is their volume ratio? Why does “square of radius” appear?
2. If a cone and a pyramid share the same base area and height, which has more volume? Explain using slices or the “three fill one” idea generalized to pyramids.
3. If you double both radius and height of a cone, by what factor does its volume change? Reason via scaling (length → volume).

## Application questions (real-world connections)

- Why are grain silos often cylindrical rather than conical, considering volume storage and structural simplicity?
- In 3D printing, layer-by-layer building mimics our “slices” idea. How would changing layer thickness affect estimated time and material use for a cylinder vs a cone?
- Engineers use hoppers (inverted cones) to funnel materials. How does the 1/3 factor help estimate how many conical hoppers equal one cylindrical tank’s volume?

## Common misconceptions and how to avoid them

- Mistake: Thinking volume scales linearly with radius. Fix: Remember area ∝ radius²; volume for cylinder/cone ∝ r²h.
- Mistake: Forgetting the 1/3 for cones. Fix: Use the “three cones fill one cylinder” image—memorable and experimentally true.
- Mistake: Mixing up ratios (3:4 of radii vs volumes). Fix: Always write variables (e.g., 3x, 4x) and compute—let algebra carry the load and cancel constants.

## Extension challenges

- Prove using similar triangles that in a cone the slice radius varies linearly with height, and use summing squares 1² + 2² + … + n² to justify the 1/3 factor without calculus.
- Generalize: Show any pyramid (any polygonal base) has volume = (1/3) × base area × height. Suggest an experiment (e.g., water fill) to verify.
- Design task: Given limited material to make a container, which shape (cylinder vs cone) gives more volume for the same surface area? Start with dimensional reasoning and simple calculus-free comparisons.

## Reflective insight (the essence)

Volume is “area carried through a height.” For shapes with constant cross-section (like cylinders), it’s exactly base area × height. For shapes that taper linearly (like cones), the cross-sectional area shrinks in a squared way, so the average area across the height is one-third of the base area—giving the elegant and powerful relation:

```math
V_{\text{cyl}} = \pi r^2 h, \quad V_{\text{cone}} = \frac{1}{3}\pi r^2 h
```

Once you see how volume ties to slices and scaling (r²h), most volume comparisons become simple, cancellation-friendly ratio problems—like today’s 9:8.
