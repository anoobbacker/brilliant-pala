## Question

Surface area of a cube is $216 \mathrm{~cm}^2$ then its volume is

## Think from first principles

### 1) What is a cube, physically?
- Imagine a dice or a sugar cube: it has 6 identical flat faces, each one a square.
- All edges have the same length. Let that length be $s$ centimeters.

### 2) How do we build surface area from scratch?
- Surface area means “how much square paper you’d need to wrap the outside.”
- Since a cube has 6 equal square faces, total surface area = area of one face × 6.
- Area of a square is “side × side” because:
  - If one side is $s$, you can lay $s$ unit-length strips across and $s$ unit-length strips down; the total number of unit squares is $s \times s = s^2$.
- So:
```math
\text{Surface area} = 6 \times (\text{area of one face}) = 6 \times s^2
```

We’re told the surface area is 216 cm²:
```math
6s^2 = 216
```
Solve for $s$:
```math
s^2 = \frac{216}{6} = 36 \quad \Rightarrow \quad s = \sqrt{36} = 6 \text{ cm}
```
(Unit check: surface area is in cm², so $s$ should come out in cm. It does.)

### 3) How do we build volume from scratch?
- Volume answers: “how many little 1 cm³ cubes fit inside?”
- For a cuboid, volume = length × width × height because you’re counting how many cubes fit along each direction.
- For a cube, all three are $s$:
```math
\text{Volume} = s \times s \times s = s^3
```
With $s = 6$ cm:
```math
V = 6^3 = 216 \text{ cm}^3
```

So the volume is 216 cm³.

### 4) Dimensional and logical sanity checks
- Surface area uses cm²; volume uses cm³. That reminds us area scales with two directions; volume with three.
- Interesting coincidence: here, the number for surface area (216) equals the number for volume (216). That’s not always true. It happens because:
```math
6s^2 = s^3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad s=6 \text{ (for } s>0 \text{)}
```
So only a cube of side 6 has equal numerical values for surface area and volume (with different units).

### 5) A compact relationship (derived, not memorized)
From $6s^2 = S$ (surface area $S$), we solved $s = \sqrt{S/6}$. Plugging into $V = s^3$ gives:
```math
V = \left(\sqrt{\frac{S}{6}}\right)^3 = \left(\frac{S}{6}\right)^{3/2}
```
For $S=216$:
```math
V = \left(\frac{216}{6}\right)^{3/2} = 36^{3/2} = (\sqrt{36})^3 = 6^3 = 216 \text{ cm}^3
```

## Multiple ways to understand

- Intuitive (net of a cube): Cut open a cube into 6 equal squares; total wrapping area is 6 times one square’s area.
- Experimental: Measure a real cube’s side with a ruler to get $s$, then compute $6s^2$; or pack it with 1 cm³ sugar cubes to estimate $s^3$.
- Scaling insight: If you doubled $s$, surface area would become 4 times bigger (since it depends on $s^2$), but volume would become 8 times bigger (since it depends on $s^3$).

## Final Answer
```math
\boxed{216 \text{ cm}^3}
```

## 1) Conceptual follow-up questions
- If the surface area of a cube becomes 9 times larger, by what factor does the side length change? What about the volume?
- For which side length $s$ (if any) is the numerical value of the surface area equal to the numerical value of the volume? Explain why.
- If a cube’s volume is 64 cm³, what is its surface area? Show your reasoning clearly from $s$ upward.

## 2) Applications to real life and science
- Packaging design: To save material (surface area) while keeping the same capacity (volume), why might certain shapes be preferred over cubes?
- Nanotechnology: When particles get smaller, their surface area-to-volume ratio increases. How does that affect reactions, drug delivery, or battery materials?
- Architecture: If a tiny house is scaled up by a factor of 3 in every dimension, how do wall area (paint needed) and room volume (air inside) change?

## 3) Common misconceptions and traps
- Mixing formulas: Using $V = 6s^2$ or $S = s^3$ — swap error. Remember area counts 2 directions (squared), volume counts 3 (cubed).
- Ignoring units: Treating cm² and cm³ as interchangeable. Always check exponents on units.
- Forgetting 6 faces: Using $S = s^2$ instead of $S = 6s^2$. A cube has 6 square faces.

## 4) Extension challenges
- Derive a general formula connecting $S$ and $V$ of a cube without $s$: show $V = (S/6)^{3/2}$ and $S = 6V^{2/3}$, and interpret the exponents via dimensions.
- Compare two cubes: one with surface area 150 cm² and another with 600 cm². Which has larger surface area-to-volume ratio? What does that imply physically (e.g., cooling rate)?
- If you scale a cube’s side by factor $k$, prove that $S$ scales by $k^2$ and $V$ by $k^3$, and explain why this matches their units (cm² vs cm³).

## 5) Reflective insight
The heart of this topic is dimensional thinking: surfaces are two-direction counts (squared), volumes are three-direction counts (cubed). Once you see area as “counting unit squares” and volume as “counting unit cubes,” the formulas $S=6s^2$ and $V=s^3$ aren’t memorized facts — they’re inevitable consequences of how space is built. This mindset lets you reconstruct results even when you forget a formula.
