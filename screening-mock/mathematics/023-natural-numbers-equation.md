## Think like a builder: turn a messy sum into a clean rectangle

When you see $x + y + xy$, think of arranging tiles:
- $xy$ is the number of tiles in an $x$-by-$y$ rectangle (interior).
- $x$ and $y$ look like “extra strips” along the sides.
- If we add 1 more tile (the corner), we can “complete the rectangle.”

This is the visual idea behind “completing the rectangle,” similar to completing the square in algebra.

## Step-by-step derivation from first principles

### 1) Start with what we’re given
```math
x + y + xy = 80
```
We want to transform this expression so that it looks like a product (because products link naturally to factor pairs, which are easier to classify for integers).

### 2) Why add 1? Build a full rectangle
Let’s compute the product $(x+1)(y+1)$ by straightforward expansion (distributive law):
```math
(x+1)(y+1) = xy + x + y + 1
```
Compare that with our left side $xy + x + y$. They are off by exactly 1.

So, add 1 to both sides of the original equation:
```math
x + y + xy + 1 = 80 + 1 = 81
```
Now use the identity we just expanded:
```math
(x+1)(y+1) = 81
```
Why this works: We literally turned “interior + side strips + corner” into a full rectangle of size $(x+1)$ by $(y+1)$.

### 3) Use factor pairs of 81
Since $x$ and $y$ are natural numbers, $x+1$ and $y+1$ are also natural numbers. We need two natural numbers whose product is 81.

Factor 81:
- $81 = 3^4$
- Positive factor pairs: $(1,81), (3,27), (9,9)$

Also, we are told $x > y$, which implies $x+1 > y+1$. So the bigger factor must be $x+1$.

Test the pairs:

- $(x+1, y+1) = (81, 1) \Rightarrow (x, y) = (80, 0)$
  - This uses $y=0$. Under the usual IGCSE convention, natural numbers start at 1, so this is not allowed.

- $(x+1, y+1) = (27, 3) \Rightarrow (x, y) = (26, 2)$
  - Valid: both natural numbers, and $x > y$.

- $(x+1, y+1) = (9, 9) \Rightarrow (x, y) = (8, 8)$
  - Not valid because $x$ is not greater than $y$ (they are equal).

So the only valid solution is:
```math
x = 26,\quad y = 2
```

Quick check:
```math
x + y + xy = 26 + 2 + (26)(2) = 28 + 52 = 80 \quad \checkmark
```

Therefore,
```math
x - 1 = 26 - 1 = 25
```

Answer: Option 3 (25).

## Multiple ways to see it

### A) Algebra-to-product (we used this)
- Add 1 to make $(x+1)(y+1)$.

### B) Divisibility viewpoint
From $x + y + xy = 80$, group terms as:
```math
x(y+1) + y = 80
```
Solve for $x$:
```math
x = \frac{80 - y}{y + 1}
```
For $x$ to be a natural number, $(y+1)$ must divide $(80 - y)$. Write
```math
80 - y = 81 - (y + 1)
```
Then
```math
x = \frac{81}{y+1} - 1
```
So $x$ is an integer exactly when $(y+1)$ divides $81$. This recovers the same factor-pair logic and leads to $(x, y) = (26, 2)$.

### C) Visual rectangle model (why the identity is true)
Imagine a grid with $(x+1)$ columns and $(y+1)$ rows:
- Interior: $xy$ squares
- One top strip: $x$ squares
- One left strip: $y$ squares
- One top-left corner: $1$ square
Total: $xy + x + y + 1 = (x+1)(y+1)$

## Conceptual follow-up questions

1. If $x$ and $y$ are positive integers and $x + y + xy = n$, show that $(x+1)(y+1) = n+1$. How does the number of solutions relate to the factor pairs of $n+1$?
2. If $n+1$ is prime, does $x + y + xy = n$ have any positive integer solutions? Why or why not?
3. If zeros were allowed (nonnegative integers), what extra solutions would appear for this problem?

## Application questions

- Systems design: In a matrix of sensors with $x$ extra along one side and $y$ along another, explain how adding a single corner module makes the total count a clean product $(x+1)(y+1)$. Why is that useful for modular design?
- Computer science: How does transforming a sum-plus-product into a product help in counting problems and algorithm optimization (e.g., turning nested loops into rectangular bounds)?

## Common misconceptions and reasoning traps

- Forgetting to add 1 to both sides: You must balance the equation before factoring.
- Assuming 0 is a natural number: Many school contexts define natural numbers as 1, 2, 3, … (no zero). Always check the convention.
- Missing the $x>y$ condition: The pair $(9,9)$ gives $x=y=8$, which is invalid here.
- Not checking all factor pairs: Don’t miss $(3,27)$ in addition to $(1,81)$ and $(9,9)$.

## Extension challenges

- Generalize: For $x + y + xy = n$ with $x, y \in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 1}$, classify all solutions using the factorization of $n+1$. How many ordered pairs $(x, y)$ are there in terms of the number of divisors of $n+1$?
- Negative integers allowed: Solve $x + y + xy = 80$ over all integers. How do negative factor pairs of 81 contribute?
- Find all $n$ such that $x + y + xy = n$ has exactly one positive integer solution with $x > y$.

## Reflective insight

The essence is pattern recognition grounded in structure: $xy + x + y$ is “almost” a product—just one step away from $(x+1)(y+1)$. By completing the rectangle (adding 1), a messy mix of sum and product becomes a clean product tied to factor pairs. This shift from additive to multiplicative thinking is a powerful general tool: when expressions mix sums and products, look for a way to “complete” a product or square to unlock number-theoretic structure.
