## Question

A carton is in the shape of a cuboid of measure 200 cm × 100 cm × 50 cm. A box is in the shape of a cube of measure 5 cm × 5 cm × 5 cm. Then how many boxes can be stored in the carton?

**Options:**
- A) 1,000
- B) 8,000
- C) 2,000
- D) 1,000

## Big idea (from everyday life)
Imagine lining up identical sugar cubes to fill a shoebox. You don’t need fancy formulas to know how many fit: you count how many cubes fit along the length, along the width, and how many layers tall you can stack. Multiply those three counts, and you have the total—because every choice of (row, column, layer) gives a unique cube position.

We’ll do exactly that, step by step, using logic you already use in real life packing.

## Step 1: What does “fit” mean for cubes?
- A cube of side 5 cm takes exactly 5 cm in length, 5 cm in width, and 5 cm in height.
- If the carton’s dimensions are whole multiples of 5, then cubes can tile the space perfectly with no gaps or leftovers. That’s because cubes tessellate 3D space (like square tiles on a floor, but in 3D).

Carton size: 200 cm × 100 cm × 50 cm  
Cube size: 5 cm × 5 cm × 5 cm

## Step 2: Count along each direction (first principles)
Along the length (200 cm):
```math
\text{cubes along length} = \frac{200\ \text{cm}}{5\ \text{cm}} = 40
```

Along the width (100 cm):
```math
\text{cubes along width} = \frac{100\ \text{cm}}{5\ \text{cm}} = 20
```

Along the height (50 cm):
```math
\text{cubes along height} = \frac{50\ \text{cm}}{5\ \text{cm}} = 10
```

Why divide? Because you’re asking: “How many 5-cm steps fit into a 200-cm stretch?” That’s the very definition of division. Units cancel cleanly: cm/cm = 1 (a pure count).

---

## Step 3: Multiply the counts (why multiplication?)
- For each of the 40 positions along the length, you can choose any of the 20 positions along the width.
- For each of those 40×20 floor spots, you can choose any of the 10 layers in height.
- That’s the fundamental counting principle: choices in independent directions multiply.

```math
\text{total cubes} = 40 \times 20 \times 10 = 8000
```

So, 8,000 cubes fit.

## Step 4: Cross-check by volume (and why this works here)
Volume of carton:
```math
V_{\text{carton}} = 200 \times 100 \times 50 = 1{,}000{,}000\ \text{cm}^3
```
Volume of one cube:
```math
V_{\text{cube}} = 5 \times 5 \times 5 = 125\ \text{cm}^3
```
Number of cubes (if they pack perfectly):
```math
N = \frac{V_{\text{carton}}}{V_{\text{cube}}} = \frac{1{,}000{,}000}{125} = 8000
```
Units check: cm³/cm³ = 1 (a pure count).  
Why valid here? Cubes fill space without gaps, and the carton dimensions are exact multiples of 5 cm, so no leftover space.

## Answer
- 8,000 cubes fit exactly.  
- Correct option: B) 8,000.

---

## Multiple ways of seeing it (engineering mindset)
- Edge-count method (discrete packing): physically stack 40 × 20 on the base, and build 10 layers → 8,000.
- Volume method (continuous check): divide total volume by one-cube volume → 8,000.
- Proportional reasoning: If you double the carton’s length, the count doubles; halve the cube’s side, the count increases by 2× in each direction (so 2³ = 8× total). This matches the idea that packing scales with the cube of size ratios.

---

## Conceptual follow-up questions
1. What if the small box had side 6 cm? How many fit along each dimension, and what leftover space remains in each direction?
2. If the cube side is 4 cm, what’s the new total? How does the 5→4 change affect the count proportionally?
3. If the carton measured 201 cm in length, does 201/5 mean 40.2 cubes along the length? Why must we take only the whole number part (floor)?
4. Why does dividing volumes fail for spheres, even if the volume ratio is an integer?

## Application questions (real-world connections)
- Packaging design: Companies choose product sizes so they tessellate shipping cartons and pallets with minimal wasted space. How would you pick dimensions to maximize fill rate?
- Warehouse robotics: How would a robot decide stacking orientation for rectangular boxes of sizes (a, b, c) in a container (L, W, H)?
- 3D printing: Voxelization uses tiny cubes to approximate shapes. How does changing voxel size affect storage and computation?

---

## Common misconceptions and reasoning traps
- “You can use the exact volume ratio for any shapes.” False—only guaranteed when shapes tessellate without gaps (like cubes). Spheres, cylinders often leave empty space.
- “Use all digits after division.” No—counts must be whole numbers because you can’t place a fraction of a rigid box.
- “Units don’t matter.” They do: always check unit consistency so you know whether a number is a length, area, volume, or a pure count.
- “Orientation doesn’t matter for rectangular boxes.” It may matter unless they’re cubes; rotating can change fit counts for non-cubes.

---

## Extension challenges
1. Non-cubic boxes: Small boxes are 10 cm × 5 cm × 5 cm. The carton is the same. What orientation maximizes count? Compute possibilities for each orientation and choose the maximum.
2. Near-miss dimensions: Small cubes are 7 cm. Compute floor(200/7), floor(100/7), floor(50/7), the total, and the wasted volume.
3. Mixed sizes: You have both 5 cm and 2.5 cm cubes. After filling with 5 cm cubes, can you use 2.5 cm cubes to fill residual gaps perfectly?
4. Optimization: If you can slightly change the cube size (between 4.5 and 5.5 cm), which size gives the best fill (least waste) for this carton?

## Reflective insight (the deep “why”)
The essence is matching “unit chunks” to “total space” along each independent direction. When a shape repeats in a grid without gaps, counting along each axis and multiplying gives the total, because 3D space factorizes into independent choices (length × width × height). Volume division is just a continuous reflection of the same idea—valid only when the discrete tiling is exact. Understanding this independence and tiling principle lets you tackle any packing problem logically, not by memorized formulas.
