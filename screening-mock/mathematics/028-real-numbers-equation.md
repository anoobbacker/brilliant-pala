## Question

a, b, c and d are real numbers such that
$\mathbf{a}-2025=\mathbf{b}+2022=\mathbf{c}-2023=\mathbf{d}+2025$, then which
of the following relation is true

**Options:**

1. a $&lt;$ b $&lt;$ c $&lt;$ d
2. $a&gt;c&gt;b&gt;d$
3. $a&gt;b&gt;c&gt;d$
4. $\mathbf{a}&gt;\mathbf{d}&gt;\mathbf{c}&gt;\mathbf{b}$

## Think-in-pictures: “Same base, different shifts”

Imagine four clocks that all show the same “true” time but each clock has its own fixed offset (one is fast by 2025 seconds, another is slow by 2022 seconds, etc.). If all share the same true time, then the one with the biggest positive offset will read the highest, and the one with the biggest negative offset will read the lowest. That’s all this problem is doing—on a number line instead of clocks.

We are told:
```math
a - 2025 = b + 2022 = c - 2023 = d + 2025.
```
This says each expression equals the same number.

## Step 1: Name the common value (base level)

When several quantities are equal to each other, they are all equal to some common value. Call it $k$:
```math
a - 2025 = b + 2022 = c - 2023 = d + 2025 = k.
```
Now solve each for the variable (we’re just undoing the +/− to isolate the letters):
```math
a = k + 2025
b = k - 2022
c = k + 2023
d = k - 2025.
```

Interpretation:
- All four are “the same base” $k$ plus an individual shift.
- The base $k$ is unknown, but the shifts (2025, −2022, 2023, −2025) are known.

## Step 2: Why comparing becomes easy

Adding the same $k$ to different numbers doesn’t change their order. If $x > y$, then $x + k > y + k$ (think of sliding two points together along the number line by the same amount; their left-right order doesn’t swap).

So to compare $a, b, c, d$, we only need to compare their shifts:
```math
\text{Compare: } 2025,\; -2022,\; 2023,\; -2025.
```

On the number line:
- Positive numbers are to the right of 0; bigger positives are farther right.
- Negative numbers are to the left of 0; among negatives, the one closer to 0 is larger (e.g., −2 is greater than −5).

Order the shifts:
```math
2025 > 2023 > -2022 > -2025.
```
Translate back using $a = k + 2025$, $c = k + 2023$, $b = k - 2022$, $d = k - 2025$:
```math
a > c > b > d.
```

## Step 3: Quick “difference” check (algebraic first principles)

You can also compare by subtracting (the unknown $k$ cancels):
- $a - c = (k+2025) - (k+2023) = 2 > 0 \Rightarrow a > c$
- $c - b = (k+2023) - (k-2022) = 4045 > 0 \Rightarrow c > b$
- $b - d = (k-2022) - (k-2025) = 3 > 0 \Rightarrow b > d$

Chain them: $a > c > b > d$.

## Step 4: Sanity check by “experiment”

Pick any $k$ (say $k=0$) to see the shape:
```math
a=2025,\; c=2023,\; b=-2022,\; d=-2025 \Rightarrow a>c>b>d.
```
Because order is invariant under adding the same number, any other $k$ gives the same order.

## Final answer

Option 2: $a > c > b > d$.

## Conceptual follow-up questions

1. If $p-5 = q+2 = r-3$, order $p,q,r$ without knowing the common value.
2. If $x+\alpha = y+\beta$ with fixed $\alpha>\beta$, which is larger, $x$ or $y$? Why?
3. If instead $a/3 = b/4 = c/5 = k$, does the same “compare shifts” idea work? What changes?

## Applications to real-life systems

- Sensor calibration: If four thermometers share the same true temperature $T$, but each has a known offset, then the displayed readings order exactly by their offsets.
- Time zones: Local time = UTC + offset. Cities with higher GMT offsets show later local times; ordering depends on offsets, not on UTC itself.
- Engineering baselines: Measurements often decompose as “true value + bias.” Comparing two biased readings reduces to comparing their biases if the true value is common.

## Common misconceptions and traps

- Mixing up negatives: Thinking −2025 > −2022 because “2025 is bigger” ignores the sign. Among negatives, the one closer to zero is larger, so −2022 > −2025.
- Thinking you must find $k$: You don’t need the actual common value to compare; it cancels in differences and doesn’t change order when added.
- Forgetting order preservation: Adding the same number to all terms preserves inequalities; multiplying by a negative flips them.

## Extension challenges

1. Generalization: If $x_i = k + \alpha_i$ for many $i$, explain why sorting the $x_i$ is identical to sorting the $\alpha_i$.
2. What operations preserve order for all real numbers?
   - Adding the same constant? Yes.
   - Multiplying by a positive constant? Yes.
   - Multiplying by a negative constant? No (reverses order).
3. Mixed form: If $p-100 = q+30 = r-40 = s+10$, rank $p,q,r,s$.
4. Product version: If $A\cdot 3 = B\cdot 2 = C\cdot 5 = k$, compare $A,B,C$. How does this differ from the additive case?

## Reflective insight

The essence: Many comparison problems can be reframed as “same base + different offset.” Once you separate the unknown common base from the known offsets, ordering becomes a matter of comparing the offsets alone. This mental model—factor out the shared part, then compare what’s different—scales to algebra, data analysis, and engineering calibration.
