## Question

The coefficient of $x^6$ in $(px^3 + 4x + \pi) \times (4x^2 - 3x^2 - 5)$ is:

**Options:**
- A) 5p
- B) 4p
- C) –5p
- D) 16p
- E) 3p

## Understand the task in plain language

- We’re multiplying two “shopping lists” of terms in x.
- Each product of terms makes a new power of x. The powers add because multiplying $x^a \cdot x^b$ means “use a copies of x and b more copies of x,” which totals $a+b$ copies: $x^{a+b}$.
- We want only the terms that create $x^6$. So we only look for pairs of terms whose exponents add to 6.

## First principles: how multiplication of polynomials works

- Distributive law (everyday idea): If you buy (A + B + C) and each is multiplied by (D + E), you get AD + AE + BD + BE + CD + CE. That’s “everything times everything.”
- In algebra, it’s the same:
  ```math
  (a_0 x^0 + a_1 x^1 + a_2 x^2 + \dots)(b_0 x^0 + b_1 x^1 + b_2 x^2 + \dots)
  ```
  becomes the sum of all $a_i x^i \cdot b_j x^j = (a_i b_j) x^{i+j}$.
- Key consequence: To get the $x^6$ term, we only need pairs where $i+j=6$.

## Check the expression as written

The problem states:
```math
(px^3 + 4x + \pi) \times (4x^2 - 3x^2 - 5).
```
- Combine like terms in the second factor: $4x^2 - 3x^2 = 1x^2$, so it simplifies to:
  ```math
  (px^3 + 4x + \pi)(x^2 - 5).
  ```
- Now consider all pairings and their exponents:
  - $px^3 \cdot x^2 = p x^{5}$ → exponent 5
  - $4x \cdot x^2 = 4 x^{3}$ → exponent 3
  - $\pi \cdot x^2 = \pi x^{2}$ → exponent 2
  - $px^3 \cdot (-5) = -5p x^{3}$ → exponent 3
  - $4x \cdot (-5) = -20 x^{1}$ → exponent 1
  - $\pi \cdot (-5) = -5\pi$ → exponent 0

None of these gives $x^6$. So, as written, the coefficient of $x^6$ is 0.

But 0 is not among the answer choices. This suggests a likely typo in the second factor.

## Likely intended correction (and why)

A common intended pattern is to have a highest power high enough to reach $x^6$ when multiplied by $px^3$. The smallest change that makes sense is:
```math
(px^3 + 4x + \pi)(4x^3 - 3x^2 - 5).
```
Why this? Because:
- $x^3 \cdot x^3 = x^6$ becomes possible.
- This matches the style of many exam items and yields one of the given options.

Let’s compute the coefficient of $x^6$ under this corrected factor.

## Find the $x^6$ coefficient (with the corrected factor)

We only need pairs whose exponents add to 6:

- From $(px^3 + 4x + \pi)$:
  - $px^3$ has exponent 3
  - $4x$ has exponent 1
  - $\pi$ has exponent 0

- From $(4x^3 - 3x^2 - 5)$:
  - $4x^3$ has exponent 3
  - $-3x^2$ has exponent 2
  - $-5$ has exponent 0

Possible sums to 6:
- 3 (from $px^3$) + 3 (from $4x^3$) = 6 → contributes $(p)(4)x^6 = 4p\, x^6$
- 1 + 5 (not available)
- 0 + 6 (not available)

So the only contribution to $x^6$ is from $px^3 \cdot 4x^3$, giving coefficient $4p$.

Therefore, matching the options, the answer is B) 4p.

## Quick dimensional/proportional sanity checks

- Highest possible degree in the corrected product: $x^3 \cdot x^3 = x^6$, so $x^6$ should be present.
- Only one pair reaches degree 6, so no risk of mixing multiple contributions.

## Two complementary ways to be sure

- Analytical (we did): only track exponent sums that reach 6.
- Experimental check (plug an easy value): Let $p=1$ and ignore $\pi$ (treat it as a constant symbol anyway). Expand just the $x^6$-relevant piece:
  ```math
  (x^3 + 4x + \pi)(4x^3 - 3x^2 - 5)
  ```
  The only $x^6$ term is $x^3 \cdot 4x^3 = 4x^6$, confirming the coefficient is 4 when $p=1$, hence $4p$ in general.

## Final answer

- If the expression is exactly as written (second factor simplifies to $x^2 - 5$): coefficient of $x^6$ is 0 (not in options).
- If the intended factor is $(4x^3 - 3x^2 - 5)$: the coefficient of $x^6$ is 4p → Option B.

Given the multiple-choice options, the intended answer is 4p.

## 1) Conceptual follow-up questions

- If the first factor were $(px^4 + 4x + \pi)$ and the second were $(4x^3 - 3x^2 - 5)$, what would be the highest degree in the product? Which pairs make it?
- If you want the coefficient of $x^5$ in $(ax^2 + bx + c)(dx^4 + ex^3 + fx)$, which exponent pairs should you check and why?
- Suppose the second factor had a term $kx^6$. Which terms in the first factor would then contribute to $x^6$?

## 2) Applications to real-life and modern problems

- Signal processing: Multiplying polynomials mirrors how filters combine; the “exponent sums” idea is like convolution of signals.
- Control systems: Characteristic polynomials of combined systems multiply; tracking specific degrees corresponds to understanding stability margins.
- Computer algebra systems: Efficiently finding a single coefficient (like $x^6$) without full expansion is key to fast symbolic computation.

## 3) Common misconceptions and traps

- Forgetting to combine like terms first: $4x^2 - 3x^2$ is $1x^2$, not $7x^2$ or $x^4$.
- Thinking $x^a \cdot x^b = x^{ab}$ instead of $x^{a+b}$. Exponents add because we’re counting total copies of x, not multiplying counts.
- Assuming many terms contribute to $x^6$ without checking exponent sums. Always list the exponent pairs that add to the target.

## 4) Extension challenges

- Given two polynomials $A(x)=\sum_{i=0}^m a_i x^i$ and $B(x)=\sum_{j=0}^n b_j x^j$, derive from the distributive law that the coefficient of $x^k$ in $A(x)B(x)$ is $\sum_{i=0}^k a_i b_{k-i}$. Explain why terms with indices outside range vanish.
- Design a fast method to extract only the $x^{50}$ coefficient from $(1+x+x^2+\dots+x^{10})^6$ without full expansion. What structure can you exploit?
- Connect to Pascal’s triangle: How does the binomial coefficient pattern generalize when multiplying polynomials with more than two terms?

## 5) Reflective insight: the essence

Multiplying polynomials is organized counting. Each term says “how many x’s” (the exponent) and “how much” (the coefficient). When you multiply, the “how many x’s” simply add (exponents add), and the “how much” multiply (coefficients multiply). To find a specific power like $x^6$, you don’t need the whole forest—just the trees whose heights add to 6. This focus on structure over expansion is the mindset that scales to bigger algebra, calculus, and even engineering systems.
