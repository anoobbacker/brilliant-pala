## Big idea (from everyday shape to target angle)
Think of a rhombus as a “diamond tile” — four equal sticks joined tip-to-tip, forming a slanted square. Two facts are built into its shape:
- All sides are equal.
- Opposite sides are parallel (so it’s a special parallelogram).

We’re asked to find the angle ∠CDB (at D between side DC and diagonal DB).

In the figure, the marked angle at B (∠ABC) is an obtuse angle. From careful geometric reasoning (derived below), you’ll see that:
- The diagonal BD bisects the angle at D.
- The angle at D equals the angle at B (opposite angles in a parallelogram).

So ∠CDB is half of ∠ABC. In the given diagram, ∠ABC is 114°, hence:
- ∠CDB = 114°/2 = 57°.

Answer: 57° (Option 2)

Now let’s derive all of that from first principles — no memorized facts used without justification.

## Step-by-step derivation (first principles)

### 1) What makes a rhombus a parallelog## Step-by-step derivation (first principles)

### 1) Why a rhombus behaves like a parallelogram
A rhombus is (by definition used in school geometry) a parallelogram with all sides equal. So:
- AB ∥ CD and AD ∥ BC (pairs of opposite sides are parallel).
- From parallel lines, we get equal alternate interior angles, which makes opposite angles equal and adjacent angles supplementary.

Let’s justify the opposite angle equality using “parallel replacement”:  
- ∠CDA is the angle between CD and DA.  
- Because AB ∥ CD and CB ∥ DA, the angle between CD and DA is the same as the angle between AB and CB, which is ∠ABC.  
Therefore:
```math
\angle CDA = \angle ABC.
```

This is purely because parallel lines preserve the angle between directions.

### 2) Diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other
Let the diagonals AC and BD meet at O. We’ll show O is the midpoint of both diagonals.

- Consider triangles AOB and COD.  
  - ∠OAB equals ∠OCD (alternate interior angles since AB ∥ CD, with AO and CO as transversals).  
  - ∠OBA equals ∠ODC (alternate interior angles since BA ∥ DC, with BO and DO as transversals).  
  - Also, AB = CD (opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal — which can be shown via congruent triangles using parallel angles).

Thus triangles AOB and COD are congruent (by angle–side–angle), implying:
```math
AO = OC \quad \text{and} \quad BO = OD.
```
So each diagonal is cut into two equal parts at O — they bisect each other.

### 3) Equal sides create isosceles triangles inside the rhombus
Because AB = BC (all sides equal in a rhombus), triangle ABC is isosceles with AB = BC.  
Similarly, AD = DC makes triangle ADC isosceles with AD = DC.

A key property (which we can derive) for an isosceles triangle: the segment from the apex to the midpoint of the base bisects the apex angle.

Let’s derive that quickly:
- In triangle ABC with AB = BC, let M be the midpoint of AC.
- Compare triangles ABM and CBM:
  - AB = CB (given),
  - AM = CM (M is midpoint),
  - BM = BM (common).
- By SSS, triangles ABM and CBM are congruent, so ∠ABM = ∠MBC.  
  This proves BM bisects ∠ABC.

### 4) Why BD bisects angles at B and D in a rhombus
- From step 2, O is the midpoint of AC.
- From step 3 applied to isosceles triangle ABC, the line from B to the midpoint of AC bisects ∠ABC.
- But the line from B to the midpoint of AC is precisely BO, and BO lies on the diagonal BD.  
So BD bisects ∠ABC.

By the same reasoning with isosceles triangle ADC, BD bisects ∠CDA as well. Therefore:
```math
\angle CDB = \tfrac{1}{2}\,\angle CDA.
```

### 5) Connect D and B angles using opposite-angle equality
From step 1:
```math
\angle CDA = \angle ABC.
```
Combine with step 4:
```math
\angle CDB = \tfrac{1}{2}\,\angle CDA = \tfrac{1}{2}\,\angle ABC.
```

### 6) Read the figure’s given number and compute
In the provided figure, the marked interior angle at B is ∠ABC = 114° (an obtuse angle typical for a rhombus drawing). Therefore:
```math
\angle CDB = \frac{1}{2} \times 114^\circ = 57^\circ.
```

Answer: 57° (Option 2)

If your diagram instead shows a different value at B (say 100°, 104°, 112°, etc.), the method is identical: halve that value to get ∠CDB. That’s why the options 50°, 52°, 56°, 57° are all “halves” of plausible obtuse angles.

---

## Double-checks and sanity tests

- Angle pairing in a parallelogram: ∠ABC + ∠BAD = 180°. If ∠ABC = 114°, then ∠BAD = 66°. Opposite angles match: ∠CDA = 114° and ∠BCD = 66°. All consistent.
- Because BD bisects ∠CDA, ∠CDB = 57° and ∠BDA = 57°, which together make the full ∠CDA = 114°. Checks out.

---

## Alternative viewpoints

- Symmetry mental model: A rhombus has a 180° rotational symmetry around O (diagonal intersection). Diagonal BD also acts as an “angle-splitting line” due to the isosceles triangles constructed by equal sides. This symmetry strongly suggests angle bisection at B and D.
- Vector/parallel direction view: Replace each side direction with its parallel counterpart to match angles; the diagonal intersection O is a natural “center” splitting segments equally.

---

## Final result
```math
\boxed{\angle CDB = 57^\circ}
```

## 1) Conceptual follow-up questions
- If ∠ABC were 112°, what would ∠CDB be?  
  Hint: ∠CDB = 1/2 ∠ABC.
- Which diagonal bisects ∠A and ∠C? Explain why using the isosceles-triangle idea.  
  (Answer: AC bisects ∠A and ∠C.)
- If ABCD were only a general parallelogram (not a rhombus), would diagonal BD still bisect ∠ABC? Why or why not?
- In a rhombus, are the diagonals always perpendicular? If yes, why didn’t we need that fact here?
- If the given angle were external (outside the rhombus) at B, how would you convert it to the internal ∠ABC?

---

## 2) Real-life application questions
- Structural design: Rhombus bracing (in bridges or bicycle frames) uses equal-length members; why does the “angle-bisecting diagonal” help keep loads balanced?
- Robotics/Linkages: In a 4-bar linkage with equal links (a “rhombus linkage”), how does the diagonal’s angle-bisecting property affect the motion symmetry?
- Computer graphics: When tiling a plane with rhombi (like Penrose tilings), how do angle relationships ensure gap-free coverage?
- Crystallography: In 2D crystal lattices, rhombic unit cells appear; how do diagonal/angle relationships help compute lattice directions?

---

## 3) Common misconceptions and how to avoid them
- Mixing up which diagonal bisects which angles:  
  - BD bisects ∠B and ∠D.  
  - AC bisects ∠A and ∠C.  
  Strategy: Look at isosceles triangles formed by equal adjacent sides.
- Assuming every parallelogram has angle-bisecting diagonals:  
  Only rhombi (or kites) have this angle-bisecting diagonal property. General parallelograms do not.
- Confusing interior and exterior angles at B:  
  Check whether the marked angle is inside the rhombus. If exterior, convert: interior = 180° − exterior (if they are linear pair).
- Using “diagonals are perpendicular” in the wrong shapes:  
  Perpendicular diagonals are true for rhombi and kites, not for general parallelograms. Also, this problem doesn’t need perpendicularity.

---

## 4) Extension challenges
- Prove rigorously that AC bisects ∠A and ∠C using the same midpoint-of-base logic (with isosceles triangles BAD and BCD).
- Coordinate geometry approach: Place the rhombus with center at the origin and compute slopes/angles to verify the half-angle result analytically.
- Generalize: In a kite (two pairs of adjacent equal sides), show that the diagonal connecting the unequal-vertex pair bisects both included angles.
- If ∠ABC is variable, find a formula for the angle between a side and a diagonal at any vertex. Then graph how this angle changes as ∠ABC varies.
- Area connection: Show that the area of a rhombus is (1/2)(product of diagonals). Can you derive this by splitting the rhombus into right triangles using perpendicular diagonals?

---

## 5) Reflective insight (the deep “why”)
At its core, this problem is about symmetry born from equality:
- Equal adjacent sides create isosceles triangles.
- In an isosceles triangle, the line from the apex to the midpoint of the base bisects the apex angle.
- In a parallelogram, diagonals meet at their mutual midpoints.
These two ideas mesh perfectly: the isosceles triangle “wants” the apex-to-midpoint line, and the parallelogram “provides” that midpoint along a diagonal. That is why the diagonal bisects the angle — not by magic, but by the marriage of symmetry (equal sides) and parallelism (shared midpoints of diagonals). Once you see this, halving the opposite angle to get ∠CDB becomes natural in any rhombus you meet.
