## Question
The minimum separation between object and its real image of a convex lens of focal length ' $f$ ' is $x f$. The value of $x$ is

Continuing:

```math
xy = f^2.
```
So minimizing S is equivalent to minimizing x + y given xy = f^2 and x, y > 0.

## Step 3: Minimize using pure reasoning (no calculus)
Key fact: For two positive numbers with a fixed product, their sum is smallest when the numbers are equal. Here’s a clean proof:

- Start with the always-true fact for any real numbers: (x − y)^2 ≥ 0.
- Expand: x^2 + y^2 − 2xy ≥ 0 ⇒ x^2 + y^2 ≥ 2xy.
- Add 2xy to both sides: x^2 + 2xy + y^2 ≥ 4xy ⇒ (x + y)^2 ≥ 4xy.
- Take square roots (both sides nonnegative): x + y ≥ 2√(xy).

Here xy = f^2, so √(xy) = f. Therefore:
```math
x + y \ge 2f,
```
with equality only when x = y = f.

Hence the minimum of S = (x + y) + 2f is:
```math
S_{\min} = 2f + 2f = 4f.
```
At the minimum, x = y = f ⇒ u − f = v − f = f ⇒ u = v = 2f.

Conclusion:
- The minimum object–image separation is 4f.
- Therefore x = 4.

## Step 4: Quick checks and intuition
- Symmetry: At the minimum we found u = v. This matches the general idea that symmetric configurations often minimize sums under a product constraint.
- Sanity check extremes:
  - If the object is just beyond the focal point (u → f+), then v → ∞, so S = u + v → ∞.
  - If the object is extremely far (u → ∞), then v → f+, so S → ∞ again.
  - So S must dip to a minimum in between, which we found at u = v = 2f.
- Dimensional analysis: There’s only one length scale f, so the minimum separation must be c·f for some pure number c. We found c = 4.

## Step 5: Alternative derivations (to strengthen understanding)

- Using algebra/“Newton’s form” directly:
  - From (u − f)(v − f) = f^2, define x = u − f, y = v − f. With xy fixed, the sum x + y is minimized at x = y. So u − f = v − f ⇒ u = v. Then 1/f = 2/u ⇒ u = v = 2f ⇒ S_min = 4f.

- Using calculus:
  - From the lens formula, solve for v in terms of u:
    ```math
    \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{u} + \frac{1}{v} \;\;\Longrightarrow\;\; v = \frac{fu}{u - f}.
    ```
  - Total separation:
    ```math
    S(u) = u + \frac{fu}{u - f}, \quad u > f.
    ```
  - Differentiate:
    ```math
    S'(u) = 1 - \frac{f^2}{(u - f)^2}.
    ```
  - Set S'(u) = 0:
    ```math
    1 = \frac{f^2}{(u - f)^2} \;\;\Longrightarrow\;\; u - f = \pm f.
    ```
  - Only u > f is valid, so u − f = f ⇒ u = 2f, and then v = 2f, giving S_min = 4f.

## Step 6: Real-world connections
- 1:1 imaging in copy machines and macro photography: To make a life-size image (magnification 1), place object and sensor about 2f from the lens on each side. The total object–image distance is then 4f. This is used in copy stands and macro setups.
- Precision optics: The “4f system” in optics (two lenses spaced properly) is a standard architecture for relaying and filtering images. While different in layout, the number 4f appears because each imaging leg uses focal-length spacing.
- Experiment you can do: Use a convex lens and a lit slide. Find two positions where a sharp real image forms on a screen. Measure u and v; adjust until they’re equal. You’ll observe the object–image separation is minimized there, and equals 4f (if you also measure f separately using distant objects).

## Final answer
```math
x = 4.
```

## 1) Conceptual follow-up questions
- What happens to the minimum separation if the lens’s focal length is doubled? Why must the answer scale linearly with f?
- Why can’t the minimum separation be less than 4f for a real image?
- If the object is at 3f, where is the image? What is the total separation? Is it larger or smaller than 4f?
- How would the story change for a virtual image (object inside focal length)? Can you even define an “object–image separation” along the axis in the same way?

## 2) Applications and modern links
- Smartphone cameras: Why does a macro mode require the camera to move its lens relative to the sensor more than for distant scenes? What does that imply about u+v?
- Optical inspection and PCB imaging: Engineers choose focal lengths and working distances to fit large boards while keeping the system compact. How does the 4f limit constrain the minimum depth of their imaging rigs?
- VR/AR and head-up displays: These often use relay lenses. Where does “4f” appear in lens spacing to keep systems compact yet sharp?

## 3) Common misconceptions and traps
- Mixing sign conventions: The object–image separation is u + v as positive lengths, even though some formulas use negative u by convention. Keep geometric lengths positive when discussing physical separations.
- Thinking “closest is at the focal length”: Putting the object at f does not give a real image on the other side; the image goes to infinity. So separation is not minimized at u = f.
- Confusing “lens-to-image” with “object-to-image”: The question asks for distance between object and its image, not between lens and image.

How to avoid them:
- Draw the ray diagram and mark all distances on a single axis.
- Use the lens formula you’ve derived, not memorized, and check limits (u → f+, u → ∞) for sanity.

## 4) Extension challenges
- If you are allowed two identical convex lenses (each focal length f), can you design a system where the object and real image are closer than 4f overall? Hint: Place the lenses cleverly; consider a relay where the first lens forms an intermediate image that the second lens reimages.
- For a fixed total track length T between object and image, what range of magnifications m are possible with a single thin lens? Derive m as a function of T and f.
- Generalize to a thick lens (principal planes separated by distance d). Show how the “4f” result modifies to include principal plane shifts, and interpret physically.

## 5) Reflective insight: the essence
At the heart is a balance between two competing distances governed by one length scale f. The lens formula ties u and v together so that pushing the object closer than 2f makes the image run away faster than the object approaches, increasing the total. Pulling the object farther than 2f makes the image huddle near f, again increasing the total. Only the symmetric point u = v = 2f balances these tendencies. That symmetry—made precise by (u − f)(v − f) = f^2 and the AM-GM inequality—is why the universal minimum is 4f. Understanding this balance lets you predict and design optical systems with confidence, not just compute them.
