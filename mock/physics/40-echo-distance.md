# Question
A man standing on a cliff claps his hand hears its echo after 1s. If found is reflected from mountain and velocity of sound in air is 340 m/s. Then the distance between the man and reflection point in meter is

## Echo intuition first

Imagine you shout toward a wall. The sound travels to the wall, bounces like a ball off a floor, and returns to you. The time you measure (1 s here) is for the whole round trip: going out and coming back.

So if you want the one-way distance to the reflection point (on the mountain), you must take half the journey.

## From first principles

- Speed is how fast distance is covered: speed = distance / time.
- For an echo, the sound covers twice the one-way distance d in time t.

So:
$$
\text{Round-trip distance} = 2d = v \cdot t \quad \Rightarrow \quad d = \frac{v\,t}{2}
$$

Now plug in v = 340 m/s and t = 1 s:
$$
d = \frac{340 \times 1}{2} = 170 \text{ m}
$$

Answer: 170 m.

Dimensional check: m/s × s = m. Then divide by 2 → still meters. Good.

## Visual aid (in words)

Man → sound travels to mountain (distance d) → reflects → travels back (distance d) → total path = 2d in 1 s.

> ### 🧠 Quick Exam Tips
> - For echoes, always divide the total time by 2 to get the one-way time.
> - Formula to remember (now understood): d = v t / 2.
> - Human ear separates an echo only if round-trip time ≳ 0.1 s → one-way distance ≳ 17 m (at 340 m/s).

## Multiple lenses

- Analytical: t = 2d/v ⇒ d = vt/2.
- Experimental: Clap near a wall: farther wall → longer echo delay. Double the delay → roughly double the distance.
- Intuitive: If time doubles, distance doubles; if speed increases (hotter air), the same echo time implies a larger distance.

## Misconception clinic

- Many students forget the divide-by-2 and answer 340 m. But that would be the full round-trip distance, not the one-way distance.
- Some think the “cliff” height matters here; it doesn’t unless the reflection point depends on geometry. Here it’s simply the straight-line one-way distance to the reflection point.

## Extensions

- Same idea powers sonar and radar: send a pulse, measure the return time, divide by 2, multiply by wave speed.
- Weather impact: if temperature rises, sound speed increases, so the same 1 s echo corresponds to a larger distance.

## Quick practice

1) If the echo is heard after 2.0 s, with v = 340 m/s, what is d?
2) If v = 300 m/s (colder air) and t = 1.0 s, what is d?
3) If the mountain is 255 m away, what echo time do you expect at 340 m/s?

Answers:
1) d = 340×2/2 = 340 m.
2) d = 300×1/2 = 150 m.
3) t = 2d/v = 2×255/340 ≈ 1.5 s.
