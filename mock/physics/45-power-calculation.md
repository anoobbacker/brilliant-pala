# Question
The force acting on a particle is $5\,\text{N}$. The velocity of the particle at an instant is $10\,\text{m/s}$. The power at that instant in W is:

## What does “power” really mean here?

Imagine pushing a shopping cart. Two things matter for how fast you’re doing work (power):
- How hard you push (force).
- How fast the cart moves in the direction you’re pushing (component of velocity along your push).

If you push sideways while the cart moves forward, that sideways part doesn’t speed it up — it does zero work. So, power depends on how aligned the force is with the velocity.

## Build from first principles

Work done in a tiny move:
$$
dW = \vec F \cdot d\vec r
$$

Power is “rate of doing work”:
$$
P = \frac{dW}{dt} = \vec F \cdot \frac{d\vec r}{dt} = \vec F \cdot \vec v
$$

So the instantaneous power is the dot product (alignment measure) of force and velocity.

- Vector form:
  $$
  P = \vec F \cdot \vec v
  $$
- Magnitude-angle form:
  $$
  P = F\,v \cos\theta
  $$
  where θ is the angle between force and velocity.
- Component form:
  $$
  P = F_x v_x + F_y v_y + F_z v_z
  $$

Unit check (dimensional reasoning):
$$
[\text{N}]\,[\text{m/s}] = (\text{kg m/s}^2)(\text{m/s})=\text{kg m}^2/\text{s}^3 = \text{W}
$$

## The answer format (since numbers are missing)

- If you have vectors, compute their dot product:
  $$
  P = F_x v_x + F_y v_y + F_z v_z \quad \text{(Watts)}
  $$
- If you only have magnitudes and the angle:
  $$
  P = F v \cos\theta \quad \text{(Watts)}
  $$

Please share the actual force and velocity (components or the angle between them) if you want a numeric value.

### Visual intuition (sketch in words)
- Draw velocity arrow to the right.
- Split the force into two parts: one along the velocity (helps or opposes motion) and one perpendicular (sideways).
- Only the along-the-velocity part contributes to power. Perpendicular force does zero power.

> ### 🧠 Quick Exam Tips
> - Instantaneous power = dot product: P = F·v (not a cross product).
> - If force is perpendicular to velocity (like centripetal force), P = 0.
> - If force opposes motion, P is negative (braking).
> - Units: N·m/s = W.

## Conceptual Follow-ups
- What if we double the speed but keep force the same and aligned? Power doubles.
- If θ = 90°, why is power zero? Because the force doesn’t change speed, only direction.

## Real-world link
- A car engine’s power at a moment equals the driving force at the wheels times the car’s speed.
- In braking, force is opposite velocity, so power is negative — energy is being taken out (dissipated as heat).

## Misconception Clinic
- Many students think “just multiply F and v.” Actually: multiply the component of F along v. That’s the dot product.
- A common mistake is assuming any nonzero force means nonzero power. Not true if the force is perpendicular to velocity.

## Extension Challenge
- Show that if P is constant, then for a mass m moving in a straight line, speed grows like v ∝ t^(1/2). Hint: P = Fv and F = m dv/dt.

## Interactive Practice
1) A force 10 N acts at 60° to the velocity of 5 m/s. What is P?
Answer: P = 10×5×cos60° = 25 W.

2) Force = (3, −2, 4) N; velocity = (2, 1, −1) m/s. Find P.
Answer: P = 3·2 + (−2)·1 + 4·(−1) = 6 − 2 − 4 = 0 W.

> Philosophical insight: Power measures alignment between cause (force) and motion (velocity). Nature rewards alignment; sideways effort doesn’t change energy.
