# Question
Weight of an object at the surface of the earth is 60 N. The mass of the object at the surface of the moon in kg is $[g_earth = 10 m/s²]$

## Mass vs Weight: What actually changes on the Moon?

Start with a real-life question: If you carry a bag of books to the Moon, do the books become fewer? No. The amount of “stuff” (mass) stays the same. What changes is how strongly the Moon pulls on it (weight).

- Mass = how much matter you have (inertia, “how hard it is to push”).
- Weight = pull of gravity on that mass (a force).

## Rebuilding from fundamentals

Imagine dropping the object. Near Earth’s surface, everything accelerates downward at g (about 10 m/s²). Newton’s second law says:
- Force = mass × acceleration.
- The gravitational force on the object (its weight) must be the mass times g.

So we don’t “start with a formula,” we reason it:
- Objects near Earth accelerate at g.
- The force causing that acceleration is weight.
- Therefore, weight = mass × g.

In symbols:
```math
W = m g
```

Given in the question:
- Weight on Earth: W = 60 N
- g_earth = 10 m/s²

Solve for mass:
```math
m = \frac{W}{g} = \frac{60\ \text{N}}{10\ \text{m/s}^2} = 6\ \text{kg}
```

Dimensional check:
```math
\frac{\text{N}}{\text{m/s}^2} = \frac{\text{kg·m/s}^2}{\text{m/s}^2} = \text{kg}
```
Units match, so the relationship is sensible.

Key idea: Mass does not depend on where you are. So the mass on the Moon is still 6 kg.

Answer: 6 kg.

## Intuition, experiment, and “what if”

- Intuitive view: The object is the same collection of atoms on Earth and on the Moon. That’s why mass stays the same.
- Experimental view: A spring scale (which measures force) will read less on the Moon. But a balance scale (comparing masses) gives the same result anywhere.
- If you’re curious, the weight on the Moon would be smaller because g_moon ≈ 1.6 m/s²:
  W_moon = 6 × 1.6 ≈ 9.6 N (about one-sixth of Earth’s).

> - Mass is location-independent; weight depends on local g.
> - Use W = m g to convert between mass and weight.
> - Units save you: N/(m/s²) = kg.

## Misconception Clinic
- Many students think mass changes on the Moon. Actually, mass is intrinsic to the object; only weight (the gravitational force) changes.
- A common mistake is to use g_moon to find mass from Earth’s weight. Don’t. Use the g where the given weight was measured.

## Fast practice
1) An object weighs 120 N on Earth. What is its mass?
m = 120/10 = 12 kg.

2) A 5 kg toolbox goes to the Moon. What’s its mass and weight there?
Mass = 5 kg (same), Weight ≈ 5 × 1.6 = 8 N.

> Nature separates “what you are” (mass) from “how the world tugs on you” (weight). Understanding that split lets you reason clearly in any gravitational environment.
