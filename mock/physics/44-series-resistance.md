# Question
Two resistors $4\,\Omega$ and $6\,\Omega$ are connected in series. The effective resistance in ohm is:

## Start with a simple picture

Imagine water flowing through two sponges placed one after the other in a pipe. The same water must pass through both sponges, and each sponge slows it down a bit. The total “slowing down” is just the sum of the two. That’s exactly how resistors in series behave for electric current.

- Series means: One path, same current through each resistor.
- Each resistor “drops” some voltage (uses up some push).
- Total voltage used = sum of individual drops.

## Build from first principles (no memorized formulas)

Let the two resistors have resistances R₁ Ω and R₂ Ω.

1. Same current I flows through both (because they’re in series — one path).
2. Each resistor obeys Ohm’s law:
   - V₁ = I R₁
   - V₂ = I R₂
3. The battery’s total voltage V must equal the sum of drops:
   - V = V₁ + V₂

Substitute using Ohm’s law:

$$
V = I R_1 + I R_2 = I (R_1 + R_2)

$$

Define an equivalent single resistor R_eq that would draw the same current I from the same voltage V:

$$
V = I R_{\text{eq}}

$$

Comparing both expressions for V:

$$
I R_{\text{eq}} = I (R_1 + R_2) \;\;\Rightarrow\;\; R_{\text{eq}} = R_1 + R_2

$$

So the effective resistance in ohms is simply the sum.

If your question had specific numbers but they didn’t display, just add them:
- Example: 3 Ω and 5 Ω in series → R_eq = 3 + 5 = 8 Ω.

## Visual intuition (in words)

- Think of current as cars on a single-lane road. Two toll booths in a row slow traffic twice — delays add.
- Electric “push” (voltage) is spent gradually. Each resistor “uses up” some push; total used equals the sum.

---

## Experimental view

- Connect two resistors end-to-end.
- Measure current I for a known battery voltage V.
- You will find R_eq = V / I equals R₁ + R₂ within measurement error.

## Analytical summary

$$
\text{Series combination: } R_{\text{eq}} = R_1 + R_2 \quad (\text{units: ohm})

$$

For n resistors in series:
$$
R_{\text{eq}} = R_1 + R_2 + \cdots + R_n
$$

> ### 🧠 Quick Exam Tips
> - Series → same current, voltages add → resistances add.
> - Parallel → same voltage, currents add → resistances combine via reciprocals.
> - Edge checks: adding a resistor in series always increases total resistance.

## Conceptual follow-ups

- What if one resistor is 0 Ω (a wire)? Then R_eq = 0 + R = R (no change).
- What if one is extremely large (open circuit)? Then R_eq is huge → current nearly zero.
- Double one resistor in series → total increases by exactly that amount.

## Application snapshots

- String lights: adding more bulbs in series increases total resistance → dimmer lights for a fixed voltage.
- Sensor chains: series resistors form voltage dividers to measure or set voltages precisely.

---

## Misconception clinic

- Many students think “two resistors always reduce total resistance.” That’s only true for parallel, not series. In series, you’re stacking obstacles → total gets larger.
- A common mistake is to average values in series. Resistances don’t average; they add because voltage drops add for the same current.

---

## Extension challenges

- Connect this to energy: Each resistor converts electrical energy to heat; total power is sum of each. Show P_total = I²(R₁ + R₂).
- Math link: It’s linear addition because Ohm’s law is linear (V ∝ I), and KVL says voltages add around a loop.

## Interactive practice

1) Two resistors 2 Ω and 7 Ω in series. R_eq = ?
- Answer: 9 Ω.

2) R₁ = 10 Ω, R₂ = 15 Ω in series across 5 V. Find current.
- R_eq = 25 Ω, I = 5/25 = 0.2 A.

3) Total series resistance is 18 Ω. One resistor is 5 Ω. What is the other?
- 13 Ω.

4) Which statement is true for series circuits?
- A) Same current through each component.  ← Correct

> Nature loves conservation. In a series path, the same flow must pass each barrier, so the “effort spent” (voltage) accumulates step by step. That’s why resistances simply add.
