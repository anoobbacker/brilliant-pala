# Question
The distance travelled by a freely falling body in one second, two seconds, three seconds, etc. are in the ratio:

- A) 1 : 1 : 1
- B) 1 : 2 : 3
- C) 1 : 3 : 5
- D) 1 : 4 : 9

---

## Key Clarification: What does “in one second, two seconds, three seconds” mean?
- If it means total distance from the start after 1 s, 2 s, 3 s, the ratio is about cumulative distances. Answer → 1 : 4 : 9 (Option D).
- If it means distance covered during the 1st second, during the 2nd second, during the 3rd second (i.e., in successive 1-second intervals), the ratio is about distances per interval. Answer → 1 : 3 : 5 (Option C).

Most literally, “in one second, two seconds, three seconds” means total distance after those times. So the intended answer is D. Below, we derive both from first principles so you see why they differ.

## First Principles Derivation (no memorized formulas)

### 1) How falling speed grows with time (why v = g t)
- Gravity gives a constant acceleration downward, called g (about 9.8 m/s²).
- Acceleration means “how much speed changes per second.”
- Starting from rest (v = 0), after time t, the speed grows linearly:
  ```math
  v(t) = g\,t
  ```
  Units check: g [m/s²] × t [s] = [m/s] → good.

### 2) How distance grows with time (why s = (1/2) g t²)
- Distance is the area under the velocity–time graph.
- For constant acceleration from rest, v–t graph is a straight line from 0 to g t, forming a triangle.
- Area of triangle = 1/2 × base × height = 1/2 × t × (g t):
  ```math
  s(t) = \frac{1}{2} g t^2
  ```
  Dimensional check: g [m/s²] × t² [s²] = [m] → good.

## Interpreting the Ratios

### A) Cumulative distances after 1 s, 2 s, 3 s
Compute s(1), s(2), s(3):
```math
s(1) = \tfrac{1}{2} g (1)^2 = \tfrac{1}{2} g
```
```math
s(2) = \tfrac{1}{2} g (2)^2 = 2 g
```
```math
s(3) = \tfrac{1}{2} g (3)^2 = \tfrac{9}{2} g
```
Now take the ratio:
```math
s(1) : s(2) : s(3) = \tfrac{1}{2} g : 2 g : \tfrac{9}{2} g = 1 : 4 : 9
```
- This matches Option D.

Visual/Intuitive model:
- Because speed grows linearly with time, distance (area under speed graph) grows like “triangle area,” i.e., like t². So 1² : 2² : 3² → 1 : 4 : 9.

Engineering/Experimental view:
- High-speed video of a falling ball with a timed strobe shows positions at t = 0, 1 s, 2 s, 3 s getting farther apart in a squared pattern—cumulative distance scales with t².

### B) Distances during each second interval (first, second, third seconds)
Now compute distances covered in successive 1-second chunks:
- First second: Δs₁ = s(1) − s(0) = (1/2)g − 0 = (1/2)g
- Second second: Δs₂ = s(2) − s(1) = 2g − (1/2)g = (3/2)g
- Third second: Δs₃ = s(3) − s(2) = (9/2)g − 2g = (5/2)g

Ratio:
```math
\Delta s_1 : \Delta s_2 : \Delta s_3 = \tfrac{1}{2}g : \tfrac{3}{2}g : \tfrac{5}{2}g = 1 : 3 : 5
```
- This matches Option C.

Deeper pattern:
- These are differences of squares:
  ```math
  s(n) - s(n-1) = \tfrac{1}{2} g \big(n^2 - (n-1)^2\big) = \tfrac{1}{2} g (2n - 1)
  ```
- The “odd numbers” (1, 3, 5, …) appear because the difference of consecutive squares is an odd number. That’s why each second adds a larger odd multiple of the base distance.

---

## Final Answer
- If the question means total distance after 1 s, 2 s, 3 s: 1 : 4 : 9 → Option D.
- If it means distance covered in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd one-second intervals: 1 : 3 : 5 → Option C.

Given the phrasing “in one second, two seconds, three seconds,” the standard interpretation is cumulative distances. So the correct choice is:

- Option D) 1 : 4 : 9

## Multiple Ways to See It

- Graphical (analytical): v grows linearly with t; area under the v–t line is a triangle → area ∝ t² → 1:4:9.
- Algebraic (first principles): s(t) = (1/2) g t²; then compute ratios directly.
- Difference method: Distances in each second are s(n) − s(n−1) = (1/2)g(2n − 1) → 1:3:5.
- Experimental: Use a ticker timer or LED strobe and photograph a falling object; measure spacing. Cumulative distances fit t²; successive spacings grow in odd-number steps.

## Conceptual Follow-up Questions
1. If an object is thrown downward with an initial speed, do the “successive-seconds” distances still follow 1:3:5? Why or why not?
2. If acceleration were not constant (e.g., due to air resistance growing with speed), would distance still scale as t²? What trend would you expect?
3. How would the ratios change on the Moon where g is smaller? Would the ratios 1:4:9 or 1:3:5 themselves change?

## Application Questions
- Why do runway distance markers for aircraft take acceleration into account, and how does the t² growth of distance influence takeoff roll and stopping distance planning?
- In sports motion capture, how can analyzing frame-by-frame positions distinguish constant acceleration (t² pattern) from constant speed (t pattern)?
- Drone delivery: How does the t² scaling affect descent planning to ensure safe landing speeds and distances?

---

## Common Misconceptions and Traps
- Mixing up “distance in t seconds” (cumulative) with “distance during the t-th second” (incremental). Fix: Always define s(t) and use Δs = s(n) − s(n−1) for successive intervals.
- Assuming “uniform acceleration” means equal distances each second. Reality: equal velocity increases each second, not equal distances.
- Forgetting dimensions. Quick check: if a formula gives distance ∝ t, that implies constant speed, not constant acceleration.

---

## Extension Challenges
- Prove that the sum of the first n odd numbers equals n² using a geometric tiling argument, then connect it to s(n) ∝ n² and Δs ∝ odd numbers.
- With air resistance proportional to speed (linear drag) at low speeds, derive or simulate how s(t) departs from t² and approaches terminal velocity behavior.
- If you sample position at uneven time intervals, how can you reconstruct whether acceleration is constant using only areas under piecewise-linear v–t approximations?

---

## Reflective Insight
The essence: Constant acceleration means constant “rate of change of speed,” not distance. Because speed grows linearly with time, the distance—being the accumulated effect (area under the speed curve)—grows like t². The odd-number pattern for successive seconds is just the difference of consecutive squares. Once you see distance as “accumulated speed,” these patterns become inevitable, not memorized.

## Three “what if” questions about falling distances

---

### 1) If an object is thrown downward with an initial speed, do the “successive-seconds” distances still follow 1:3:5? Why or why not?

- Start from first principles: distance is the area under the velocity–time graph. With constant downward acceleration $g$ and initial downward speed $u$:
- Velocity grows linearly: 
```math
v(t) = u + g t
```
(units: m/s = m/s + m/s²·s)

- Distance in time $t$ is area under the straight-line $v(t)$ from 0 to $t$, which is a trapezoid (or “average speed × time”):
```math
s(t) = \text{avg speed} \times t = \frac{u + (u + g t)}{2}\, t = u t + \frac{1}{2} g t^2
```
(units: m = m/s·s + m/s²·s²)

- Distance covered during the $n$-th second (i.e., between $t=n-1$ and $t=n$):
```math
\Delta s_n = s(n) - s(n-1) 
            = \big[u n + \tfrac{1}{2} g n^2\big] - \big[u(n-1) + \tfrac{1}{2} g (n-1)^2\big]
            = u + \tfrac{1}{2} g \big(n^2 - (n-1)^2\big)
            = u + \tfrac{1}{2} g (2n - 1)
```

- What does this mean?
  - If $u = 0$ (dropped from rest): $\Delta s_n \propto (2n-1)$ → 1:3:5.  
  - If $u \neq 0$: each one-second chunk equals “a constant baseline $u$” plus “odd-number growth” from gravity. So the ratios are not exactly 1:3:5; they depend on $u$.
  - The increments are an arithmetic sequence with constant step:
```math
\Delta s_{n+1} - \Delta s_n = g
```
    So each second you add the same extra distance compared to the previous second, but only if $u=0$ do those extras start at “1 unit” and line up as 1:3:5.

- Visual intuition (v–t graph):
  - With $u=0$, the area in each second is “odd-number chunks” of triangle area → 1, 3, 5…
  - With $u>0$, there’s an added rectangle of area $u \times 1$ in each second. That equal rectangle distorts the pure 1:3:5 ratio.

---

### 2) If acceleration were not constant (e.g., due to air resistance growing with speed), would distance still scale as t²? What trend would you expect?

- Realistic forces: gravity downward ($mg$) and drag upward (increasing with speed). Two common models:
  - Linear drag (low speeds): $F_\text{drag} = b v$
  - Quadratic drag (higher speeds): $F_\text{drag} = c v^2$

- Acceleration becomes smaller over time:
  ```math
  a(t) = \frac{dv}{dt} = g - \frac{F_\text{drag}(v)}{m}
  ```
  As $v$ grows, drag grows, so $a(t)$ decreases. The $v(t)$ curve bends over and approaches a constant “terminal velocity” $v_t$ where drag balances weight.

- Consequences for distance:
  - Early times (small $t$): speed is small, drag is small, so $a \approx g$. You recover the $t^2$ behavior:
    ```math
    s(t) \approx \frac{1}{2} g t^2 \quad \text{for } t \ll \text{(drag timescale)}
    ```
  - Later times: acceleration fades toward 0; velocity approaches a constant $v_t$; distance then grows roughly linearly:
    ```math
    s(t) \approx v_t\, t \quad \text{for } t \gg \text{(drag timescale)}
    ```

- Trend for “successive-seconds” distances:
  - They start by increasing (like 1:3:5 would suggest for no drag).
  - Then the increases taper off and eventually become nearly equal each second once $v \approx v_t$ (constant spacing, like 1:1:1).

- Intuitive picture:
  - Without drag: v–t is a straight slanted line → area grows like a triangle → $t^2$.
  - With drag: v–t is a curve that flattens → area transitions from curved-up ($t^2$) to straight ($t$).

---

### 3) How would the ratios change on the Moon where g is smaller? Would the ratios 1:4:9 or 1:3:5 themselves change?

- If dropped from rest (no initial speed) and still ignoring air resistance (the Moon basically has none):
  - Position after $t$: $s(t) = \tfrac{1}{2} g_\text{Moon} t^2$.
  - Cumulative distances after 1 s, 2 s, 3 s:
    ```math
    s(1) : s(2) : s(3) = 1^2 : 2^2 : 3^2 = 1 : 4 : 9
    ```
    The $g$ cancels in the ratio, so it’s unchanged.
  - Successive one-second chunks:
    ```math
    \Delta s_n = \tfrac{1}{2} g_\text{Moon} (2n-1) \;\Rightarrow\; 1 : 3 : 5
    ```
    Again $g$ cancels in the ratio. The ratios are the same; only the actual distances are smaller.

- If thrown downward with initial speed $u$:
  - Successive seconds:
    ```math
    \Delta s_n = u + \tfrac{1}{2} g_\text{Moon} (2n-1)
    ```
    A smaller $g_\text{Moon}$ means the “odd-number growth” part is weaker compared to $u$. So the three distances become more similar to one another (ratios move closer to 1:1:1 if $u$ dominates). Only when $u=0$ do you recover the exact 1:3:5.

- Summary:
  - From rest: ratios 1:4:9 (cumulative) and 1:3:5 (successive seconds) do not change with $g$.
  - With initial speed: the ratios depend on $u/g$; on the Moon (smaller $g$), they are closer to equal if $u$ is the same.

## Multiple views to cement intuition

- Graphical: Area under the v–t curve is distance. Straight line (constant $a$) → triangle area ∝ $t^2$. Curving over (drag) → transitions toward rectangle growth ∝ $t$.
- Dimensional: With only $g$ and $t$, the only length you can form is $g t^2$. Add drag with a timescale (e.g., $\tau = m/b$) and a terminal speed ($v_t$), and long-time growth must look like $v_t t$.
- Experimental: Strobe photos of a falling ball in air show spacings that first widen then approach equal spacing; on the Moon they keep widening (no air) and match the $t^2$ law perfectly.

---

## Conceptual follow-up questions
1. If you throw the object upward instead, what do the successive-seconds distances look like before and after it reaches the top?
2. How would these patterns change if gravity weakened with height (e.g., very tall drop) instead of being constant?
3. Can two different motions (one with drag, one without) produce the same three successive-seconds distances? What extra measurement would distinguish them?
4. If you record position at uneven time steps, how can you detect whether acceleration is constant using only geometry of the v–t estimate?

---

## Application questions
- Space engineering: Why does the near-vacuum on the Moon make descent timing rely more on $t^2$ scaling, while on Earth gliders and parachutes rely on approaching a terminal speed?
- Automotive safety: Braking distance grows roughly with $v^2$ when tire-road friction limits are constant; how is this analogous to “distance ∝ area under v–t”?
- Sports analytics: How can frame-by-frame position data tell whether an athlete is under nearly constant acceleration (e.g., sprint start) versus drag-limited motion?

---

## Common misconceptions and reasoning traps
- Confusing “equal increases of velocity each second” (constant acceleration) with “equal distances each second” (constant velocity).
- Forgetting that adding an initial speed $u$ adds the same rectangular area each second to the v–t graph, distorting the 1:3:5 pattern.
- Believing $t^2$ scaling must hold forever; with drag, long-time behavior becomes linear in $t$.

---

## Extension challenges
- Prove geometrically that $n^2 = 1 + 3 + 5 + \dots + (2n-1)$ and map each odd number to the extra triangle area added each second in the v–t graph.
- For linear drag, show (or simulate) that $v(t) = v_t(1 - e^{-t/\tau})$ from rest and derive $s(t) = v_t t - v_t \tau (1 - e^{-t/\tau})$. Identify the crossover from $t^2$ to $t$.
- With a nonzero initial speed $u$, plot $\Delta s_n$ vs $n$ and show it’s a straight line of slope $g$ and intercept $u - \tfrac{1}{2}g$.

---

## Reflective insight
Distance is accumulated speed. If acceleration is constant, speed grows linearly, so distance grows quadratically—differences of those quadratics are the odd numbers. Add an initial speed and you add the same “area block” each second, bending the ratio away from pure 1:3:5. Let acceleration fade (drag), and the speed curve flattens, shifting distance growth from $t^2$ toward $t$. See the shape of the v–t curve, and the distance patterns become obvious.
