# Answer


## From Everyday Thinking to the Answer

Imagine every molecule is like a tiny “recipe.” If one mole of the compound contains 1 mole of carbon atoms and 2 moles of oxygen atoms, that means each molecule has 1 C and 2 O atoms — the “recipe” is CO2.

Why? A mole is just a giant count (like a dozen, but much bigger). If in one mole of molecules you count 1 mole of C atoms and 2 moles of O atoms, then per molecule the ratio must be 1 C : 2 O.

## Build the Mass from First Principles

Step 1: Identify the formula from the atom ratio  
- One C and two O per molecule → formula is CO2.

Step 2: Add up the masses of the atoms in one molecule  
- Use relative atomic masses: Ar(C) = 12, Ar(O) = 16.

Step 3: Sum for the molecule (one C plus two O’s):
$$
M(\mathrm{CO_2}) = 1 \times 12 + 2 \times 16 = 12 + 32 = 44
$$

- As a number: relative molecular mass (Mr) = 44.
- As a unit-bearing quantity: molar mass = 44 g/mol.

Answer: 44 (or 44 g/mol if they want units).

## Dimensional and Intuitive Checks

- Units: For molar mass we use g/mol — fits “mass per mole.”
- Proportional logic: Two oxygens contribute twice 16, which dominates the total. So answer should be significantly more than 32 but not huge — 44 fits.

## Experimental View (How you’d notice in a lab)
If you collected exactly 1 mole of CO2 gas, its mass would be 44 g (at any conditions, mass stays 44 g per mole; volume changes with temperature/pressure, but molar mass doesn’t).

> - “Mole is a count.” If 1 mole of compound has 1 mole C and 2 moles O → formula is CO2.
> - Mr (no units) and molar mass in g/mol have the same number for IGCSE data.

## Misconception Clinic
- Many students think “1 mole of compound = 1 mole of atoms total.” Actually, 1 mole of CO2 has 3 moles of atoms (1 C + 2 O per molecule).
- A common mistake is mixing volume with mass for gases. Molar mass (44 g/mol for CO2) is fixed; gas volume changes with conditions.

## Quick Practice
1) What’s the molar mass of H2O?  
Ar(H) = 1, Ar(O) = 16 → 2×1 + 16 = 18 g/mol.

2) If 1 mole of a compound has 1 mole Mg, 1 mole C, and 3 moles O, what’s its formula and molar mass?  
Formula: MgCO3; M = 24 + 12 + 3×16 = 84 g/mol.

> Chemistry “recipes” are ratios. Once you see the ratio, the mass is just careful counting with a scale. Understanding the count-to-mass bridge is the key to fast, reliable answers.
