# Answer

## Start with a simple question
Why is water liquid, air a gas, and ice solid at the same room temperature? Because there’s a tug-of-war between:
- thermal jiggling (how energetically particles move), and
- stickiness (how strongly particles attract each other).

If the jiggling beats the stickiness, particles fly apart: gas.  
If stickiness wins but not too strongly, particles stay close yet slide: liquid.  
If stickiness dominates strongly, particles lock into place: solid.

Room temperature is about 298 K (25°C). So an element will be a liquid at 298 K only if its melting point is below 298 K and its boiling point is above 298 K.

```math
\text{Liquid at } 298\text{ K} \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad T_\text{melt} < 298\text{ K} < T_\text{boil}
```

## Examine the options with this lens

1) Chlorine (Cl2): small, light molecules with weak attractions (London dispersion).  
- Melting point ≈ −101°C, Boiling point ≈ −34°C → at 25°C it’s a gas.

2) Mercury (Hg): yes, it’s famously liquid at room temperature — but it’s a metal, not a non-metal.  
- So it doesn’t answer “liquid non-metal.”

3) Bromine (Br2): heavier than chlorine, stronger attractions.  
- Melting point ≈ −7°C, Boiling point ≈ 59°C → at 25°C it’s between these, so it’s a liquid.  
- And bromine is a non-metal.

4) Phosphorus (P): solid at room temperature.  
- White phosphorus melts at ≈ 44°C, so at 25°C it’s still solid.

Answer: 3) Bromine.

## Intuition first, terms later
- Intuitive picture: As you go down the halogens (F2, Cl2, Br2, I2), the atoms get bigger, electron clouds get fluffier and more “squishable.” Squishier clouds make stronger momentary attractions (think: velcro that grips better). This extra “stickiness” pushes the boiling point up.
- Technical terms:
  - “Squishiness” of the electron cloud = polarizability.
  - The resulting attraction = London dispersion forces.
  - Trend: F2, Cl2 gases; Br2 liquid; I2 solid at room temperature.

## Multiple lenses

### Analytical view
Use melting/boiling points:
- Bromine: −7°C < 25°C < 59°C → liquid.
- Chlorine: 25°C > −34°C (but 25°C is above its boiling), so gas.
- Phosphorus: 25°C < 44°C, so solid.
- Mercury: liquid, but not a non-metal.

### Experimental view
- In a lab bottle, bromine is a dark reddish-brown liquid that fumes easily (volatile). Chlorine comes as a greenish gas. Phosphorus appears as a waxy solid (white P must be kept under water). Mercury is a shiny, silvery liquid metal.

### Intuitive “what changes if we go heavier?”
- Heavier halogen → more electrons → more polarizable → stronger dispersion → higher boiling point → more likely to be liquid/solid at 25°C.

## Quick exam recall

> ### 🧠 Quick Exam Tips
> - Only two elements are liquid at room temperature: Mercury (metal) and Bromine (non-metal).
> - Halogen states at room temperature: F2, Cl2 = gases; Br2 = liquid; I2, At2 = solids.
> - “Liquid non-metal at room temperature” → Bromine.

## Misconception clinic
- Many students pick Mercury because it’s the famous “liquid metal,” but the question asks for a liquid non-metal.
- “Isn’t chlorine in pools a liquid?” Pool “chlorine” is usually compounds or chlorine dissolved in water. Pure chlorine at 25°C is a gas.
- “Phosphorus melts easily, so maybe it’s liquid?” White phosphorus melts at about 44°C, which is above room temperature, so at 25°C it’s solid.

## Extension connection
The same reasoning (size → polarizability → stronger dispersion → higher boiling point) explains why:
- Iodine is a solid that sublimes (solid → gas).
- Noble gases trend: He, Ne are gases; heavier ones like Xe have higher boiling points.

## Practice questions
1) Which halogen is a solid at room temperature: chlorine, bromine, or iodine?  
2) Why does bromine have a higher boiling point than chlorine?  
3) Name the only liquid metal at room temperature.  
4) True/False: If Tmelt < 298 K < Tboil, the substance is a gas at 298 K.

Answers:
1) Iodine. 2) Larger, more polarizable electron cloud → stronger London dispersion. 3) Mercury. 4) False; that’s the condition for a liquid.
