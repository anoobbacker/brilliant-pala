## Question
How many different products are produced when electricity is passed through an aqueous solution of sodium chloride in chlor-alkali process?

## Short answer
Three different products are formed: chlorine gas (Cl2), hydrogen gas (H2), and sodium hydroxide solution (NaOH).

## Build-up from first principles

### 1) What’s in salty water (brine)?
Everyday idea: When table salt (sodium chloride, NaCl) dissolves in water, it breaks into tiny charged pieces that can move.

- NaCl(aq) contains:
  - Positive ions: Na+
  - Negative ions: Cl−
  - Lots of water molecules, H2O (which can also take part in reactions)

Electricity moves charges. So when we connect a battery:
- Negative electrode (cathode) pushes electrons into the solution.
- Positive electrode (anode) pulls electrons out.

This sets up a “who can gain electrons at the cathode?” and “who can lose electrons at the anode?” contest.

### 2) What happens at the cathode (negative electrode)?
Two candidates can accept electrons:
- Na+ could gain electrons to become sodium metal (Na).
- Water molecules could gain electrons to make hydrogen gas (H2) and hydroxide ions (OH−).

Which is more likely? Think real-world behavior:
- Pure sodium metal thrown into water reacts violently, making NaOH and H2. So if sodium metal formed in water, it would instantly react back with water. That suggests nature avoids making sodium metal in water because it’s energetically unfavorable there.
- Water turning into hydrogen gas is a common and more “gentle” pathway in aqueous electrolysis.

So, water is reduced at the cathode, producing hydrogen gas and hydroxide ions:
```math
2 H_2O + 2 e^- \to H_2 + 2 OH^-
```
Why this equation?
- Atom balance: 2 hydrogens in H2 come from water; the leftover O and H combine to make OH−.
- Charge balance: left side has −2 (from 2 e−); right side has 2 × (−1) = −2 (from 2 OH−).

Result at the cathode:
- A gas forms: H2 (hydrogen)
- The solution near the cathode becomes alkaline due to OH−.

### 3) What happens at the anode (positive electrode)?
Two candidates can lose electrons (be oxidized):
- Cl− could lose electrons to form chlorine gas (Cl2).
- Water could lose electrons to form oxygen gas (O2) and H+.

Which happens? In concentrated brine (the chlor-alkali process uses high [Cl−]):
- Chloride ions are abundant and can pair up to form Cl2 gas.
- In practice, forming O2 from water needs extra “push” (called overpotential), so chloride usually wins in brine.

So, chloride is oxidized at the anode:
```math
2 Cl^- \to Cl_2 + 2 e^-
```
Check:
- Atom balance: 2 Cl− → Cl2.
- Charge balance: left −2, right gives 2 e− (−2), so electrons account for charge loss.

Result at the anode:
- A gas forms: Cl2 (chlorine)

### 4) Where does NaOH come from?
We now have:
- Cathode makes OH− (stays in solution).
- Na+ was in solution from the start.
They simply pair up in solution to give sodium hydroxide, NaOH(aq).

We can “add up” the two half-reactions to see the overall change. First, include the spectator Na+ to show it ends up attached to OH−:

Cathode:
```math
2 H_2O + 2 e^- \to H_2 + 2 OH^-
```

Anode:
```math
2 Cl^- \to Cl_2 + 2 e^-
```

Add Na+ as a spectator to pair with OH−:
```math
2 Na^+ + 2 Cl^- + 2 H_2O \to Cl_2 + H_2 + 2 Na^+ + 2 OH^-
```

Group Na+ with OH− on the right as NaOH:
```math
2 NaCl(aq) + 2 H_2O(l) \to Cl_2(g) + H_2(g) + 2 NaOH(aq)
```

This confirms the three products:
- Chlorine gas, Cl2
- Hydrogen gas, H2
- Sodium hydroxide solution, NaOH

### 5) Experimental clues you can see/smell/test
- Bubbles at the cathode: hydrogen (test with a lit splint → “pop” sound).
- Bubbles at the anode: chlorine (greenish-yellow gas, characteristic smell—handled only with proper safety).
- The solution becomes alkaline (blue litmus stays blue; red litmus turns blue), proving OH− is produced → NaOH forms with Na+.

### 6) Why industrial cells keep products separate
If chlorine meets NaOH, a side reaction makes bleach (sodium hypochlorite):
```math
Cl_2 + 2 NaOH \to NaCl + NaClO + H_2O
```
So modern chlor-alkali plants use membranes/diaphragms to physically separate anode and cathode compartments.

## Final count and list
- Number of different products: 3
- Products: chlorine gas (Cl2), hydrogen gas (H2), sodium hydroxide solution (NaOH)

## 1) Conceptual follow-up questions
- What changes if you electrolyze molten NaCl instead of aqueous NaCl? (Hint: No water present; sodium metal can form.)
- In very dilute NaCl(aq), why might oxygen form at the anode instead of chlorine?
- If NaOH and Cl2 are allowed to mix, why do you get bleach (NaClO) rather than just regenerating NaCl?
- How would you experimentally confirm that OH− is formed near the cathode without measuring pH directly?

## 2) Applications to real-life and modern tech
- Saltwater pool “chlorinators” generate chlorine in situ—how do they manage pH and avoid mixing Cl2 with NaOH?
- Hydrogen from chlor-alkali plants can be used as a fuel. What design features improve capture and purity?
- PVC manufacturing depends on Cl2. How do plants ensure safe transport and storage of chlorine gas?
- Membrane cells drastically reduce environmental impact compared to older mercury cells. What materials make selective ion membranes work?

## 3) Common misconceptions and traps
- “Sodium metal forms at the cathode in brine.” False in water: water is reduced instead, forming H2 and OH−. Sodium metal forms only from molten NaCl or non-aqueous systems.
- “Oxygen always forms at the anode.” Not in concentrated brine: chloride is preferentially oxidized to Cl2 due to concentration and overpotential effects.
- “NaOH is added from outside.” No, it is produced in situ: OH− from water reduction pairs with Na+ already present.
- “Products can be stored together.” No—Cl2 and NaOH react to form bleach; industrial cells keep them separated.

## 4) Extension challenges
- Balance electrons to derive product ratios: For every 1 molecule of Cl2 made, how many molecules of H2 and units of NaOH form? Connect this to the electrons transferred in each half-reaction.
- Design a simple lab-scale chlor-alkali setup with a separator. What materials would you choose for electrodes and membrane, and why?
- Predict outcomes if you replace NaCl with KCl. What stays the same? What changes practically (e.g., solubilities, membrane transport)?
- Model the effect of temperature and chloride concentration on the competition between Cl2 and O2 formation at the anode.

## 5) Reflective insight: the essence
Electrolysis outcomes are determined by which species can most “easily” give up or take electrons under the conditions, while obeying conservation of mass and charge. In aqueous NaCl, water beats Na+ at the cathode (so H2 forms), and Cl− beats water at the anode (so Cl2 forms), leaving Na+ to partner with the newly made OH− to give NaOH. Understanding these cause-and-effect competitions—rather than memorizing products—lets you predict electrolysis results in almost any electrolyte.
