# Answer

## Which formula is phosphoric acid?

### Start with a simple question
How can a name tell us a formula? Think of the name “phosphoric acid” as a blueprint:
- “phosphor-” points to phosphorus (P).
- “-ic acid” hints that it comes from an “-ate” ion.
- The relevant ion is phosphate: PO4 with a 3− charge.

## Build it from first principles (not memory)

An acid like H3PO4 is formed by adding H+ (hydrogen ions) to a negative ion until the total charge becomes zero.

- The phosphate ion is PO4^3− (charge = −3).
- Let x be the number of H+ ions we must add.

Charge balance:
$$
(+x) + (-3) = 0 \Rightarrow x = 3
$$
So we need 3 hydrogens: H3PO4.

Textual diagram: Picture PO4 as a tetrahedral group with “three missing-charge plugs.” Each H+ is like a plug that neutralizes one negative charge. Three plugs fill all three gaps → neutral molecule H3PO4.

## Eliminate the wrong options

- B) Ca(OH)2 is calcium hydroxide — a base (contains OH−).
- C) NaOH is sodium hydroxide — also a base.
- Therefore, the chemical formula of phosphoric acid is A) H3PO4.

Answer: A) H3PO4

## Multiple lenses

- Analytical view: Derived by charge neutrality from PO4^3− + 3H+ → H3PO4.
- Intuitive view: Number of acidic H’s equals the charge on the “-ate” ion. Phosphate (3−) → three H.
- Experimental view: H3PO4 is a triprotic acid; it can neutralize base in three steps (pH titration shows three equivalence points).

> - “-ate” anion → “-ic” acid (phosphate → phosphoric acid).
> - Number of H in the acid equals the negative charge of the anion (PO4^3− → H3PO4).
> - Hydroxides (…OH or …(OH)2) are bases, not acids.

## Conceptual follow-ups
- What about phosphorous acid? That’s different: it comes from phosphite (PO3^3−), giving H3PO3 (one H is bonded to P and is not ionizable).
- Is H3PO4 strong or weak? It’s a weak, triprotic acid (donates H+ in three steps, each progressively weaker).
- How many ionizable hydrogens here? All three in H3PO4 are bonded to oxygen and can dissociate.

## Misconception clinic
- Many students think any formula with H is an acid. But NaH (sodium hydride) is a base! Context matters.
- A common mistake is mixing up phosphoric (H3PO4) and phosphorous (H3PO3). “-ous” corresponds to “-ite,” not “-ate.”
- Students often assume OH means acid because it has H; actually OH− signals a base (hydroxide).

> Names in chemistry aren’t labels to memorize; they’re codes. Decode the charge and pattern, and the formula reveals itself. Understanding structure and charge turns memory work into logic.
