## Big idea in plain language
If you leave different metals out in the open (air, moisture, soil), most of them quickly react with the environment and turn into compounds like oxides (with oxygen), sulfides (with sulfur), or carbonates (with carbon dioxide and water). Only a few metals are so “uninterested” in reacting that they can stay as pure, shiny metal for millions of years. Those are the ones we find “in the free (native) state” in the Earth’s crust.

Why? Because oxygen and sulfur “want” electrons strongly, and most metals are eager to give electrons. When the “electron trade” releases energy, the reaction happens and the metal won’t remain free.

## From first principles: Why some metals stay native
- Everyday observation:
  - Iron rusts (iron oxide) in moist air.
  - Silver tarnishes slowly (silver sulfide).
  - Aluminium doesn’t seem to corrode, but that’s because it instantly forms a thin, tough oxide layer that protects it (passivation).
  - Gold stays shiny for centuries; it hardly reacts.

- Cause-effect model:
  - A metal atom can lose electrons to become a positive ion. Oxygen (or sulfur) can gain electrons to form oxide (or sulfide) ions.
  - If giving electrons (by the metal) and taking them (by oxygen/sulfur) together lowers energy overall, the reaction is spontaneous, and the metal gets “locked” into a compound.
  - Only metals that very strongly resist losing electrons (noble metals) avoid this fate and can remain native.

- Simple redox picture:
  
  ```math
  \text{Metal oxidation: } M \to M^{n+} + n e^-
  ```
  ```math
  \text{Oxygen reduction (in moist air): } O_2 + 4 e^- + 2 H_2O \to 4 OH^-
  ```
  If combining these gives a big energy drop, the metal won’t stay free.

- Geological filter:
  - Over geological times, reactive metals get converted into stable ores (oxides, sulfides, carbonates).
  - Only the least reactive (noble) metals persist as free metals: typically gold, platinum (and related metals), silver, and sometimes copper.

## Evaluate each metal in the list (with reasons)
We’re checking: Is it commonly found in the Earth’s crust as native (free) metal?

i) Nickel — No  
  - Usually in sulfide ores (pentlandite) or silicates. Native nickel is extremely rare on Earth’s crust; more common as iron–nickel in meteorites, which isn’t what the question means.

ii) Iron — No  
  - Very reactive with oxygen and water → rusts. Native iron on Earth’s surface is rare; most native iron samples are meteoritic or rare “telluric” iron.

iii) Zinc — No  
  - Quite reactive; found as sulfide (sphalerite) or carbonate. Not native.

iv) Copper — Yes  
  - Much less reactive; can exist as native copper, especially in reducing geological environments (e.g., the Keweenaw Peninsula deposits).

v) Lead — No  
  - Though low on the reactivity scale, it readily forms galena (PbS). Native lead is very rare; typically not counted as a native-metal source.

vi) Silver — Yes  
  - Noble enough to occur native, though it can tarnish slowly to Ag2S in sulfur-rich air.

vii) Tin — No  
  - Commonly as cassiterite (SnO2). Not native.

viii) Platinum — Yes  
  - Very noble; resists oxidation; found as native platinum grains or nuggets.

ix) Aluminium — No  
  - Extremely reactive but “hides” behind a protective Al2O3 film. In nature it exists in ores like bauxite, not as native metal.

x) Lithium — No  
  - Highly reactive; never native.

xi) Gold — Yes  
  - The classic native metal; chemically very unreactive in air and water.

xii) Magnesium — No  
  - Highly reactive; forms oxides/hydroxides; not native.

## Answer
- Metals found in free (native) state here: Copper (iv), Silver (vi), Platinum (viii), Gold (xi)
- Count = 4

## Multiple ways to see it
- Intuitive/observational: Which metals visibly resist corrosion over long periods? Gold, platinum, silver (slow tarnish), copper (forms a protective patina). These can survive as native.
- Theoretical/redox: Metals with very low tendency to give electrons (noble metals) don’t drive oxidation by oxygen/water, so they remain uncombined.
- Geological/empirical: Surveys of ore deposits show Au, Pt (and Pt-group metals), Ag, and Cu occurring in native form; others occur predominantly as compounds.

## Quick comparison mental model
Think of the Earth’s surface as a giant “oxidizing bath” (O2, H2O, CO2, H2S). Only metals that don’t “feed” electrons to this bath remain unreacted. Those are the noble metals; copper is borderline but still qualifies.

## Conceptual follow-up questions
1. If Earth’s atmosphere had no oxygen, how would the list of native metals change?
2. Why does aluminium, which doesn’t corrode much in daily life, still not occur as native metal in nature?
3. Silver tarnishes to Ag2S over time. Why, despite this, is silver still considered a native metal?
4. Why are meteorites a common source of native iron-nickel but Earth’s crust is not?

## Application questions
1. Jewellery uses gold and platinum. Connect this choice to their native occurrence and corrosion resistance in sweat, air, and seawater.
2. Why are copper roofs and statues historically popular, and how does the green patina relate to copper’s ability to occur natively?
3. In designing corrosion-resistant structures, what lessons do engineers borrow from the behavior of noble vs reactive metals?

## Common misconceptions and reasoning traps
- “Aluminium doesn’t rust, so it must be native.”  
  Trap: Aluminium is extremely reactive; it just passivates. That makes it durable in daily life but not native in crust.
- “Heavier metals like lead should be native.”  
  Trap: Weight has nothing to do with reactivity. Lead forms stable sulfides and oxides readily.
- “If a metal can be found native somewhere on Earth, that means it’s generally native.”  
  Trap: Rarity matters. The question asks about typical, common occurrence in the crust, not rare anomalies.

## Extension challenges
- Use standard reduction potentials (E° values) to rank the given metals by tendency to exist natively. Explain qualitatively without memorizing numbers: which half-reactions “pull” electrons more strongly?
- Research a deposit where native copper forms. What geological conditions (e.g., reducing fluids, lack of sulfur) allowed it?
- Consider Mars’ atmosphere (mostly CO2, very thin). Predict which metals might be more likely to remain native there compared to Earth.

## Reflective insight
The essence: Native metals are survivors in an aggressive, oxidizing world. Whether a metal is found free is not about how shiny or heavy it is—it is about how strongly it resists giving away electrons to oxygen, water, or sulfur over vast times. That single idea—electron transfer tendency—predicts who stays free and who gets locked into ores.
