# Answer

## Which is called baking soda?

### Start with a real-world question
Why does a cake rise and become fluffy? Because tiny bubbles of gas form inside the batter and expand in the oven. Where do those bubbles come from? From a powder that releases carbon dioxide when heated or when mixed with an acid. That powder is baking soda.

### The substance behind the bubbles
Baking soda is sodium hydrogen carbonate, also called sodium bicarbonate.

- Chemical formula: NaHCO₃
- What it does: releases carbon dioxide gas, which makes dough/batter expand.

Two ways it makes CO₂:
$$
\text{(with acid)}\quad \text{NaHCO}_3 + \text{H}^+ \rightarrow \text{CO}_2\uparrow + \text{H}_2\text{O} + \text{Na}^+
$$
$$
\text{(on heating)}\quad 2\,\text{NaHCO}_3 \xrightarrow{\Delta} \text{Na}_2\text{CO}_3 + \text{CO}_2\uparrow + \text{H}_2\text{O}
$$

So, the correct answer is:
- B) NaHCO₃

### Why the other options are not baking soda
- A) CaCO₃: Calcium carbonate — chalk/limestone; doesn’t behave as a kitchen leavening agent.
- C) Na₂CO₃: Sodium carbonate — “washing soda,” used for cleaning/water softening.
- D) NaOH: Sodium hydroxide — “caustic soda,” very corrosive, not for baking.

> ### 🧠 Quick Exam Tips
> - Baking soda = sodium hydrogen carbonate = sodium bicarbonate = NaHCO₃.
> - Baking powder = baking soda + a dry acid + starch (so it can generate CO₂ without adding vinegar/lemon).
> - Washing soda = Na₂CO₃; Caustic soda = NaOH. Don’t mix up the “sodas.”

## Deep Learning Layer

### Conceptual Follow-ups
- What if you used Na₂CO₃ instead of NaHCO₃? It’s a stronger base, can make the food taste soapy and doesn’t release CO₂ as cleanly without an acid.
- Why add vinegar or lemon juice to recipes with baking soda? The acid speeds up CO₂ release at room temperature.

### Experimental View
- Add a spoon of baking soda to vinegar: observe fizzing (CO₂). Repeat with washing soda and note differences in speed/extent.

### Misconception Clinic
- Many students think baking soda and baking powder are the same. Actually, baking powder already contains an acid; baking soda does not.
- A common mistake is assuming “carbonate” and “bicarbonate” are identical. Bicarbonate (hydrogen carbonate) has an extra H, which makes it react with acids to release CO₂ more readily in cooking.

### Extension Challenge
- Link to respiration: Your blood carries CO₂ as bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻). Same ion, different context — chemistry repeats across biology and cooking.

### Interactive Practice Questions
1) Which ingredient would make baking soda fizz the most?
   a) Water  b) Vinegar  c) Oil  d) Salt  
   Answer: b) Vinegar (acid)

2) Short answer: Why does baking powder still work without lemon juice?  
   Hint: It already contains a dry acid to react with the bicarbonate.
