# Answer


## What gas forms when zinc meets concentrated sulfuric acid?

Start with a picture you’ve seen: drop a metal into acid and you see bubbles. Those bubbles are a gas made by electrons moving from the metal to something in the acid. The key question is: who takes the electrons?

- In dilute acids, hydrogen ions (H+) usually take the electrons and turn into H2 gas.
- In hot, concentrated sulfuric acid, the sulfur in H2SO4 itself takes the electrons. That changes the product gas.

So with Zn + concentrated H2SO4, the gas evolved is sulfur dioxide, SO2.

Correct answer: C) SO2

## Why SO2, not H2? Build from first principles

1. Metals like zinc want to lose electrons (get oxidized).
2. Something in the acid must accept those electrons (get reduced).
3. Two possible “electron takers” in sulfuric acid:
   - H+ → H2 (typical for dilute acids)
   - Sulfur in H2SO4 (S is in a high oxidation state, +6) → can be reduced to SO2 (S at +4), especially when acid is concentrated/hot. Concentrated H2SO4 is a strong oxidizing agent.

Oxidation numbers show the electron bookkeeping:
- Zn: 0 → +2 (loses 2 e−)
- S in H2SO4: +6 → +4 in SO2 (gains 2 e−)

Half-reactions in acidic medium:
```math
\text{Oxidation: } \mathrm{Zn \rightarrow Zn^{2+} + 2e^-}

\text{Reduction: } \mathrm{SO_4^{2-} + 4H^+ + 2e^- \rightarrow SO_2 + 2H_2O}
```

Combine them:
```math
\mathrm{Zn + 2H_2SO_4 \rightarrow ZnSO_4 + SO_2\uparrow + 2H_2O}
```

Experimental lens:
- Gas has a choking, pungent smell (SO2). It turns acidified KMnO4 from purple to colorless or acidified K2Cr2O7 from orange to green (because SO2 is a reducing gas). No “pop” test like H2.

Intuitive lens:
- Concentrated H2SO4 behaves less like a “hydrogen-releaser” and more like an “electron-hungry oxidizer,” so sulfur gets reduced to SO2 instead of H+ making H2.

> - Dilute H2SO4 + Zn → H2 gas.
> - Hot, concentrated H2SO4 + Zn (or Cu) → SO2 gas.
> - NO2 is from concentrated HNO3 with many metals, not from H2SO4.
> - SO2 reduces acidified KMnO4 (purple to colorless) and K2Cr2O7 (orange to green).

## Conceptual Follow-ups

- What if the acid were dilute H2SO4? You’d get H2 gas: Zn + H2SO4(dilute) → ZnSO4 + H2.
- What if you used copper with hot conc. H2SO4? You still get SO2: Cu + 2H2SO4(conc) → CuSO4 + SO2 + 2H2O.
- Why not O2? Because sulfuric acid doesn’t release O2 in this context; it is being reduced (not oxidized further).

## Misconception Clinic
- Many students think “acid + metal always makes H2.” True for many dilute acids, but concentrated H2SO4 is an oxidizing agent, so it makes SO2 instead.
- Some pick NO2 because they recall “brown gas with concentrated acid” — that’s concentrated nitric acid (HNO3), not sulfuric acid.
- Thinking “more oxygen in the acid means O2 forms” is tempting, but here oxygen remains bound; sulfur is the species getting reduced.

## Mini Practice
1) Which gas evolves when Mg reacts with concentrated H2SO4?  
- Answer: SO2 (same oxidizing behavior).

2) Which test distinguishes SO2 from H2 quickly?  
- Answer: Acidified KMnO4 test (SO2 decolorizes it; H2 does not).

3) With dilute HCl and Zn, what gas forms?  
- Answer: H2 (HCl is not an oxidizing acid).

> ### 🌱 Reflective Essence
> Chemistry often asks, “Who takes the electrons?” The product you see (H2 vs SO2) is decided not by the metal alone, but by which part of the acid acts as the electron-acceptor under the conditions. Understanding the electron story makes the memory effortless.
