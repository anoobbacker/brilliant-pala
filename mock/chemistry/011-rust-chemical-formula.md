# Answer


### Start with a real-world picture

Why does a wet bicycle chain turn reddish-brown and flaky?  
Because iron reacts with oxygen in the presence of water to form a new substance that “holds on” to water inside its structure. That’s why we write xH₂O: the amount of water varies. So rust isn’t a single fixed compound, but a family of hydrated iron(III) oxides.

Technical name after the idea is clear: “hydrated ferric oxide.”

## Build it from first principles: what actually happens when iron rusts?

Think cause-and-effect: electrons move, and new ions form.

1) Iron gives up electrons (oxidation) at tiny spots on the metal surface:
```math
\text{Anode: } \quad \mathrm{Fe(s)} \rightarrow \mathrm{Fe^{2+}(aq)} + 2e^-
```

2) Oxygen from air accepts those electrons (reduction) in the presence of water:
```math
\text{Cathode: } \quad \mathrm{O_2(g)} + 2\mathrm{H_2O(l)} + 4e^- \rightarrow 4\mathrm{OH^- (aq)}
```

3) The ions meet in the water film on the metal:
```math
\mathrm{Fe^{2+}} + 2\mathrm{OH^-} \rightarrow \mathrm{Fe(OH)_2 (s)}
```

4) This first forms greenish ferrous hydroxide, which further reacts with oxygen/water to form ferric hydroxide:
```math
4\mathrm{Fe(OH)_2} + \mathrm{O_2} + 2\mathrm{H_2O} \rightarrow 4\mathrm{Fe(OH)_3}
```

5) Over time, some water is lost from Fe(OH)₃, turning into a variable, hydrated iron(III) oxide:
```math
\mathrm{Fe(OH)_3} \;\rightarrow\; \mathrm{Fe_2O_3 \cdot xH_2O} \quad (\text{rust})
```

Key idea: Water is not just a bystander; it’s both a reaction medium and part of the final rusty solid. That’s why x (an undefined number) is needed.

## What is “rust” chemically?

Answer: Fe₂O₃·xH₂O — hydrated iron(III) oxide.  
From the options given, that’s B (and C, which is the same).

## Why the other options are wrong

- Fe₂O₃·CH₃: “CH₃” is a methyl group; iron oxide doesn’t naturally bind a random methyl like that in rusting.
- FeCl₃·xH₂O: That’s hydrated iron(III) chloride (a salt), not the reddish-brown flaky oxide on your bike.
- Note: The list shows B and C identical. The correct chemical nature remains hydrated iron(III) oxide: Fe₂O₃·xH₂O.

## Intuition tools

- If there’s no water, rusting is extremely slow. Dry oxygen alone doesn’t make your nail rust quickly.
- Salt water speeds rust because it carries ions well, making the tiny “battery” on the iron surface more efficient.

> ### 🧠 Quick Exam Tips
> - Rust = hydrated iron(III) oxide = Fe₂O₃·xH₂O.
> - Needs BOTH oxygen and water; salt speeds it up.
> - “x” means variable amounts of water — rust isn’t a single fixed formula.

## Misconception Clinic

- Many students think rust is just Fe₂O₃ (no water). But actually, the real flaky stuff is hydrated: Fe₂O₃·xH₂O.
- A common mistake is mixing up FeCl₃ with rust because both contain Fe³⁺. But FeCl₃ is a salt; rust is an oxide.
- Some think “x” is a number you must memorize. No — it varies with conditions; that’s the point.

## Mini practice

1) Which condition will rust an iron nail fastest?
   - A: Dry air
   - B: Boiled (oxygen-free) water with oil on top
   - C: Air + water
   - D: Salt water
   Correct: D (salt water is best conductor, accelerates rusting)

2) Why is stainless steel more resistant to rusting?
   - Because it forms a thin, tightly-adhering protective oxide layer (chromium oxide) that stops further oxygen attack.

> “Rusting” teaches a timeless pattern: where electrons can move and a path exists for charge to return, nature builds a tiny battery — and the material changes. Control the paths (exclude water/oxygen, use barriers, or provide a sacrificial metal), and you control the transformation.
