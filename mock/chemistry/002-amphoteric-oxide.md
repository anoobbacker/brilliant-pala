# Answer

## Intuition First: What does “amphoteric” feel like?

Imagine a “bilingual” friend who can speak to two different groups. In chemistry, an amphoteric oxide is “bilingual” — it can react with both acids and bases. Most metal oxides are clearly basic (they neutralize acids), and most non-metal oxides are acidic. But a few special oxides sit in the middle and can play on both teams.

## Build from First Principles

### Why do oxides act acidic or basic?
- Metals hold onto oxygen as O2− (oxide ion). Oxide ion is strongly basic — it wants to grab H+ and form water. So most metal oxides are basic.
- Nonmetals form covalent oxides that often react with bases (they’re acidic).
- Borderline metals (with moderate charge and size) make oxides that are neither strongly basic nor acidic — these can react with both. That’s amphoteric behavior.

Intuitive trend:
- Far left metals (like Na, Mg, Ca): oxides are strongly basic.
- Nonmetals on the right (like P, S): oxides are acidic.
- In between or “borderline” metals (Al, Zn, Pb, Sn, Be): oxides are amphoteric.

So among CaO, MgO, FeO, ZnO — zinc is one of those classic borderliners.

## Analytical View: Show it by reactions

Amphoteric means: reacts with acids and with bases.

For ZnO:
$$
\text{With acid:}\quad \text{ZnO} + 2\text{HCl} \rightarrow \text{ZnCl}_2 + \text{H}_2\text{O}
$$
$$
\text{With base (aqueous):}\quad \text{ZnO} + 2\text{NaOH} + \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{Na}_2[\text{Zn(OH)}_4]
$$
That complex ion [Zn(OH)4]2− is called “zincate.”

Check others quickly:
- CaO: strongly basic; reacts with acids, not with bases.
- MgO: basic (less strong than CaO), but still not reacting with bases.
- FeO: mostly basic at IGCSE level.

Therefore, the only amphoteric one here is ZnO.

Answer: D) ZnO

## Experimental View: How would you test this?

- Add each oxide to dilute HCl: all basic oxides (CaO, MgO, FeO, ZnO) will react to form salts and water.
- Then try adding each oxide to warm, concentrated NaOH solution:
  - CaO, MgO, FeO: no reaction.
  - ZnO: dissolves, forming a zincate complex. That’s the amphoteric signature.

## Intuitive View: Periodic table sense-making

- Moving across a period: oxides shift from basic → amphoteric → acidic.
- Zinc sits near the boundary where “metallic but not too metallic” behavior lives. Its oxide is not strongly basic or acidic, so it can do both.

## Why this helps in exams (pattern > memory)

If you remember just the pattern — strong metals = basic oxides; nonmetals = acidic; borderliners (Al, Zn, Pb, Sn, Be, Cr in some states) = amphoteric — then you can quickly spot ZnO as amphoteric without memorizing every example.

> ### 🧠 Quick Exam Tips
> - Amphoteric oxides react with BOTH acids and bases: think Al2O3 and ZnO as must-know examples.
> - Strongly basic oxides: Group 1 and 2 metals (Na2O, CaO, MgO).
> - Nonmetal oxides are usually acidic (SO2, CO2).
> - Borderline metals (Al, Zn, Sn, Pb, Be) often form amphoteric oxides/hydroxides.

## Misconception Clinic
- Many students think “amphoteric = neutral.” Not true. Amphoteric means “reacts with both acids and bases,” not “no reaction.”
- A common mistake is assuming “all transition metal oxides are amphoteric.” Not correct at this level. FeO is mostly basic; ZnO is a classic amphoteric exception you should know.    
- “If it reacts with HCl, it must be basic only.” Amphoteric oxides also react with acids, but the real test is: do they also react with bases? ZnO does.



## Mini Practice
1) Pick the amphoteric oxide:
  - A) Al2O3
  - B) Na2O
  - C) SO3
  - D) CaO
Answer: A) Al2O3

2) Which reaction shows amphoterism?
  - A) MgO + HCl → MgCl2 + H2O
  - B) ZnO + NaOH + H2O → Na2[Zn(OH)4]
  - C) SO3 + NaOH → Na2SO4 + H2O
Answer: B

3) True/False: FeO is amphoteric. Answer: False (IGCSE level: mainly basic)

## Reflective Essence
> Chemistry loves the middle ground: when a particle isn’t extreme in either direction, it can “speak both languages.” Amphoterism is nature’s way of showing that many properties form a spectrum, not a simple yes/no.
