# Answer

## Which of these are gases at 1 atm and 300 K?

Let’s think like a scientist first.

Everyday clue: Air (mostly nitrogen and oxygen) stays invisible and fills the room. Your gold ring doesn’t float away as gold vapor. Why? Because whether something is a gas, liquid, or solid at a given temperature and pressure is a tug-of-war between two things:
- Thermal motion trying to spread particles apart.
- Attractive bonds trying to hold them together.

At room-like conditions (1 atm, about 27°C = 300 K), small molecules with weak attractions tend to be gases. Substances with strong bonding networks (metals, diamond) stay solid.

### The core criterion (built from first principles)
- Thermal energy scale at temperature T is roughly:
  $$
  E_{\text{thermal}} \sim k_B T
  $$
  At 300 K, this is enough to separate weakly attracting molecules like N₂, O₂, CO₂, but nowhere near enough to break the strong bonding in metals or diamond.

- Practical test for exams: Compare 300 K to the substance’s boiling point (or sublimation point at 1 atm).  
  - If 300 K is above its boiling/sublimation point, it’s a gas.  
  - If far below, it’s solid (or liquid).

## Evaluate each substance

i) Carbon dioxide (CO₂)  
- At 1 atm, CO₂ does not form a liquid; it sublimates at −78.5°C (194.7 K).  
- 300 K is well above that → it’s a gas.

ii) Diamond (C_diamond)  
- Giant covalent network; extremely high sublimation temperature (thousands of K).  
- At 300 K → solid (not gas).

iii) Gold (Au)  
- Strong metallic bonding; melts only above ~1337 K.  
- At 300 K → solid.

iv) Nitrogen (N₂)  
- Boiling point at 1 atm: ~77 K.  
- 300 K is much higher → gas.

v) Silver (Ag)  
- Strong metallic bonding; melts only above ~1235 K.  
- At 300 K → solid.

vi) Oxygen (O₂)  
- Boiling point at 1 atm: ~90 K.  
- 300 K is much higher → gas.

Result: gases are CO₂, N₂, O₂ → 3 substances.

> - Metals and network solids (diamond, SiO₂) are solid at room conditions.  
> - Small, nonpolar molecules with low boiling points (N₂, O₂, CO₂) are gases at 1 atm and ~300 K.

## Analytical view (fast checks)
- Room conditions: 1 atm, 300 K (~27°C).
- Compare 300 K to phase-change temperatures at 1 atm:
  - N₂: boils at 77 K → gas at 300 K.
  - O₂: boils at 90 K → gas at 300 K.
  - CO₂: sublimes at 195 K → gas at 300 K.
  - Au, Ag: melt far above 300 K → solid.
  - Diamond: sublimes far above 300 K → solid.

Count = 3.

## Experimental view
- A cylinder labeled “N₂” or “O₂” dispenses gas at room conditions.  
- “Dry ice” (solid CO₂) left on a table vanishes into fog and gas; no puddle forms at 1 atm.  
- Metals and diamond obviously do not evaporate at room temperature.

---

## Intuitive view and “what if”
- If you increase pressure at 300 K:
  - CO₂ can be liquefied by pressure alone (its critical temperature is ~304 K, close to 300 K).
  - N₂ (critical temperature ~126 K) and O₂ (~154 K) cannot be liquefied by pressure alone at 300 K; you must cool them first.

---

## Misconception Clinic
- “CO₂ can’t be a liquid.”  
  Many students think this because at 1 atm CO₂ skips liquid. But under higher pressure (above its triple point), CO₂ can be a liquid.
- “If something is not boiling, it can’t be gas.”  
  Actually, boiling is about a phase change from liquid; a substance can already be a gas at the given conditions without any boiling (e.g., O₂ at 300 K).
- “Diamond melts before it becomes gas.”  
  At 1 atm, diamond does not melt; it essentially sublimes (or burns in oxygen) at very high temperatures.

## Interactive Practice
1) At 1 atm and 300 K, which are gases: Cl₂, Br₂, I₂?  
   - Cl₂: gas (boiling ~239 K). Br₂: liquid. I₂: solid (sublimes).  
2) Can you liquefy N₂ at 300 K by increasing pressure?  
   - No, 300 K is above its critical temperature; must cool below ~126 K first.  
3) Is water a gas at 1 atm and 300 K?  
   - No, the stable phase is liquid; water vapor exists in air, but pure H₂O at 1 atm is liquid at 300 K.

> Phase is a balance: random thermal motion trying to spread things out vs bonding trying to hold them together. Know the contest, and you can predict the winner at any T and P.

Final answer: 3 gases (CO₂, N₂, O₂).
