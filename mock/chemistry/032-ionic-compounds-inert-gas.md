# Answer

## Goal
Find which ionic compound has both its cation and anion ending up with the same noble gas (inert gas) electron configuration.

## Start with an everyday picture
Imagine atoms like people trying to fill seats in a small cinema row called the “outer shell.” Noble gases are the “already-perfect seating plans.” Other atoms will give away or take seats (electrons) to copy the nearest perfect plan. That’s what ions do in ionic (electrovalent) compounds.

Key idea: After transfer, each ion wants a noble-gas-like electron count. But “octet” doesn’t always mean they become the same noble gas. You must check the actual number of electrons.

## Rebuild from fundamentals
- Metals lose electrons → become positively charged (cations) → drop back to the previous noble gas.
- Nonmetals gain electrons → become negatively charged (anions) → move forward to the next noble gas.

Compute electrons in an ion by:
$$
\text{Electrons in ion} = Z \pm \text{charge}
$$
- Use “−” for cations (lost electrons), “+” for anions (gained electrons).
- Then match that number to a noble gas: He (2), Ne (10), Ar (18), Kr (36), …

## Check each option step-by-step

1) Calcium fluoride, CaF2
- Ca → Ca2+: 20 − 2 = 18 electrons → [Ar]
- F → F−: 9 + 1 = 10 electrons → [Ne]
- Not the same.

2) Sodium chloride, NaCl
- Na → Na+: 11 − 1 = 10 electrons → [Ne]
- Cl → Cl−: 17 + 1 = 18 electrons → [Ar]
- Not the same.

3) Sodium oxide, Na2O
- Na → Na+: 11 − 1 = 10 electrons → [Ne]
- O → O2−: 8 + 2 = 10 electrons → [Ne]
- Same noble gas (both Ne). ✓

4) Magnesium chloride, MgCl2
- Mg → Mg2+: 12 − 2 = 10 electrons → [Ne]
- Cl → Cl−: 17 + 1 = 18 electrons → [Ar]
- Not the same.

Answer: 3) Sodium oxide (Na2O)

## Intuition builder: How to predict quickly
- Group 1 metals (like Na, K) go back 1 electron to the previous noble gas.
- Group 2 metals (like Mg, Ca) go back 2.
- Group 16 nonmetals (like O, S) go forward 2.
- Group 17 nonmetals (like F, Cl) go forward 1.

To have “same noble gas,” both ions must land on the same target. Example patterns:
- Na+ and O2− → both Ne (works)
- Mg2+ and O2− → both Ne (works, e.g., MgO)
- K+ and Cl− → both Ar (works, e.g., KCl)

Counterexamples:
- Ca2+ and F− → Ar vs Ne (don’t match)
- Na+ and Cl− → Ne vs Ar (don’t match)

> ### 🧠 Quick Exam Tips
> - Don’t stop at “octet.” Check which noble gas each ion matches.
> - Use electrons = atomic number ± charge, then map to He (2), Ne (10), Ar (18), …
> - Common “same noble gas” pairs: Na2O, MgO, KCl, K2S.

---

## Conceptual follow-ups
- What if we replace Na with K in NaCl? KCl: K+ has 19 − 1 = 18 → [Ar]; Cl− also 18 → [Ar]. Now they match.
- Why doesn’t CaO match? Ca2+ → 18 [Ar], O2− → 10 [Ne]. Different noble gases.

---

## Experimental lens
In a lab, you can’t “see” electron configurations directly, but periodic trends and known charges (Na+1, Mg+2, O−2, Cl−1) reliably predict these noble gas endpoints, which correlate with lattice stability and typical ionic radii.

---

## Misconception clinic
- Many students think “both reach octet, so they’re the same.” But actually, Ne and Ar are both octets, yet different electron counts (10 vs 18).
- A common mistake is assuming all compounds of a metal with a nonmetal give the same noble gas to both ions. It depends on the period (row) as well as the group.

---

## Extension challenges
- Chemistry to materials: The ion sizes (Ne-like vs Ar-like) affect crystal packing and melting points. Compare Na2O vs CaO structures and properties.
- Cross-discipline: This is like modular arithmetic—different start points but same “target class” (noble gas) after adding/subtracting electrons.

## Interactive practice
1) Which pairs have both ions with the same noble gas?
   a) MgO  b) LiF  c) KCl  d) Na2S
- Answers: a) MgO (both Ne), c) KCl (both Ar). LiF: He vs Ne; Na2S: Ne vs Ar.

2) Predict for K2O: K+ → 18 (Ar), O2− → 10 (Ne). Same? No.

3) Predict for CaS: Ca2+ → 18 (Ar), S2− → 18 (Ar). Same? Yes.

> Nature prefers stable patterns. Atoms don’t “memorize formulas”; they simply move toward the nearest stable arrangement. If you track electron counts logically, patterns like matching noble gases pop out automatically.
