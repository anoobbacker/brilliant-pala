   4) $AB$

# Answer


## Predict the formula from atomic numbers 1 and 17

### Start with a simple picture
Imagine partners at a dance:
- Hydrogen (A) and Chlorine (B) each want exactly one “handshake” to feel complete.
- If each wants one, they naturally pair 1-to-1.

That’s the intuition. Now let’s rebuild why from first principles.

## From atomic number to bonding behavior

- Element A has atomic number 1 → it’s Hydrogen (H).
  - Electrons: 1 (configuration 1s¹).
  - Goal: reach a stable “duet” like Helium (2 electrons in the first shell).
  - So H needs 1 more electron and can form 1 bond.

- Element B has atomic number 17 → it’s Chlorine (Cl).
  - Electrons: 17 (configuration 2,8,7).
  - Goal: reach a stable octet (8 in the outer shell).
  - So Cl needs 1 more electron and can form 1 bond.

Key idea: both are nonmetals, so they share a pair of electrons → a single covalent bond. Each needs just one bond, so the ratio is 1:1.

- Lewis dot picture (in words): H• and •Cl with 7 dots around Cl; they share one pair to make H:Cl.

Therefore, the formula is one H with one Cl → AB.

$$
\text{Balanced reaction from diatomic elements:}\quad H_2 + Cl_2 \rightarrow 2\,HCl

$$

Answer: 4) AB

## Analytical view (the “why” in symbols)
- Valency approach (built from needs, not memorized):
  - H needs 1 → valency 1
  - Cl needs 1 → valency 1
- To satisfy both “needs” evenly, combine in the smallest whole-number ratio: 1:1 → AB.

## Experimental view
- HCl is a gas at room temperature.
- In water, it ionizes strongly: HCl → H⁺ + Cl⁻ (hydrochloric acid).
- But the ratio stays 1:1 in any case.

---

## Intuitive checks
- Double H? Then Cl can’t satisfy two H at once—Cl has only 1 “bond slot.”
- Double Cl? Same issue—the extra Cl has no partner.
- So the minimal balanced partnership is 1:1.

> - Atomic number → electron configuration → how many electrons needed to be stable → number of bonds.
> - Nonmetals sharing one pair each → single covalent bond → 1:1 if both need one electron.
> - Hydrogen (Z=1) and halogens like Cl (Z=17) usually make HX (1:1).

## Conceptual follow-ups
- If A had valency 2 and B had valency 1, you’d expect A B₂ (because one A can “hold” two B’s).
- Try a few:
  - Mg (Z=12, valency 2) with Cl (Z=17, valency 1) → MgCl₂ (AB₂).
  - Al (Z=13, valency 3) with Cl (Z=17) → AlCl₃ (AB₃).
  - H (Z=1) with S (Z=16, valency 2) → H₂S (A₂B).

---

## Misconception clinic
- Many students think “halogens always form ionic compounds.” But H–Cl is covalent as a gas; in water it ionizes. Bonding can be context-dependent.
- A common mistake is criss-crossing charges blindly. First understand “how many electrons does each need?” The ratio follows from that need.

## Quick practice
1) Element X has Z=1, Y has Z=16. Predict the formula.  
2) Element P has valency 2, Q has valency 3. Smallest whole-number formula?

Answers:
1) H with S (needs 2) → H₂S.  
2) Cross the needs: P₃Q₂ (because 2×3 = 3×2 to balance needs).

> “Deep pattern”: Stability drives structure. Count what each atom “needs” to be stable; the simplest ratio that satisfies all needs gives the formula. Understanding need → ratio beats memorizing formulas.
