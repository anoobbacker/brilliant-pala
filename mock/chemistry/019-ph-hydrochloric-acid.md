# Answer


## What does “pH of 1 M hydrochloric acid” really mean?

Start with a feeling: lemon juice tastes sour because it’s full of “free” hydrogen ions (H+). pH is just a way to count how crowded those H+ ions are, using a smart, compressed scale.

Think of pH like a loudness knob: each step is 10×, not 1×. That’s why we use a logarithm.

## Build from first principles

### Step 1: Define pH in plain words, then in math
- Plain idea: pH measures how many free H+ ions are in the water.
- Technical definition (ideal solution):
  $$
  \text{pH} = -\log_{10} [\text{H}^+]
  $$
  where [H+] is the concentration of hydrogen ions in moles per liter (mol L⁻¹).

### Step 2: What does hydrochloric acid do in water?
- Everyday picture: HCl “falls apart” in water into H+ and Cl⁻ like a LEGO block splitting into two pieces.
- Technical reaction:
  $$
  \text{HCl (aq)} \rightarrow \text{H}^+ (aq) + \text{Cl}^- (aq)
  $$
  Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid, meaning it dissociates essentially completely in water.

### Step 3: Link concentration to pH
If the solution is 1.0 M HCl, and it fully dissociates, then:
$$
[\text{H}^+] \approx 1.0 \text{ M}
$$
So
$$
\text{pH} = -\log_{10}(1.0) = 0
$$

Answer: pH = 0.

## Intuition checks and quick sanity tests

- Proportional logic: Double [H+] → pH drops by 0.301 (because −log10(2) ≈ −0.301). So stronger acid means smaller pH.
- Dimensional check: pH is dimensionless (log of a ratio), so “0” is a pure number—this fits.

## Tiny real-world refinement (beyond IGCSE)
In very concentrated solutions, ions interact and the “effective” concentration (activity) is slightly different from the simple molarity. For 1.0 M HCl, the ideal answer is pH = 0. Real measurements can be a little above 0 because of activity coefficients. For IGCSE exams, use pH = 0.

## Visual aid (in words)
Picture a beaker:
- One HCl becomes one H+ and one Cl⁻.
- For every 1 mole of HCl per liter, you get 1 mole of H+ per liter.
- The “crowdedness” of H+ is 1 mol/L → log10(1) = 0 → pH 0.

## Worked mini-variants (pattern recognition)
- 0.1 M HCl: pH = −log10(0.1) = 1
- 2.0 M HCl (ideal): pH = −log10(2.0) ≈ −0.301 (yes, pH can be negative for very concentrated strong acids)

> ### 🧠 Quick Exam Tips
> - Strong acid → complete dissociation: HCl → H⁺ + Cl⁻.
> - pH = −log10[H⁺] (use mol/L).
> - 1.0 M strong monoprotic acid → [H⁺] = 1.0 M → pH = 0.
> - “Strong” ≠ “concentrated”: strength is about dissociation, concentration is how much is present.

## Conceptual follow-ups
- What if you dilute 1.0 M HCl 10×? [H⁺] becomes 0.10 M → pH increases by 1 unit (to 1). Dilution raises pH (less acidic).
- What if temperature changes? The auto-ionization of water (Kw) shifts, slightly changing neutral pH from 7. But for strong acids at these concentrations, the main effect is still the acid.

## Real-world connections
- Stomach acid is roughly pH 1–2: close to a 0.1–0.01 M strong acid.
- Industrial pickling uses strong acids with pH near or below 0.

## Misconception clinic
- Many students think “pH can’t be negative.” Actually it can, for [H⁺] > 1 M.
- A common mistake is assuming “pH scale is strictly 0 to 14.” That’s a convenient range for dilute solutions at 25°C, not a hard rule.
- Don’t mix up strong vs concentrated: a 0.001 M HCl is strong (fully dissociated) but not concentrated; its pH is 3.

## Extension challenge
- Math link: Logarithms turn multiplication into addition. That’s why a 10× change in [H⁺] becomes a +1 or −1 change in pH.
- Biology link: Enzymes are sensitive to pH because H+ crowding changes protein shape and function.

## Interactive practice
1) What is the pH of 0.01 M HCl?  
2) If you mix equal volumes of 1.0 M HCl and water, what is the new pH (ideal)?  
3) Which has lower pH: 0.5 M HCl or 0.05 M HCl?

Answers:
1) 2 (since −log10(0.01) = 2).  
2) Concentration halves to 0.50 M → pH = −log10(0.50) ≈ 0.301.  
3) 0.5 M HCl (more H+ → smaller pH).
