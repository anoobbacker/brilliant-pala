# Question
Given below are two statements, one is labelled as Assertion (A) and the other is labelled as Reason (R):  
**Assertion (A):** Hydrogen gas is evolved when zinc ($\text{Zn}$) metal reacts with dilute hydrochloric acid  
**Reason (R):** All metals displaces hydrogen from  dilute hydrochloric acid  

In the light of the above statements select the most appropriate answer from options given below:  
   1) Both A and R are correct and R is the correct explanation of A  
   2) Both A and R are correct but R is not the correct explanation of A  
   3) A is correct but R is false  
   4) R is correct but A is false

# Answer

## Do all metals fizz with acid? Why does zinc do it but copper doesn’t?

Imagine putting different metals into dilute hydrochloric acid (HCl). Some fizz with bubbles (hydrogen gas), some just sit quietly. Why?

Let’s test the statements:

- Assertion (A): Hydrogen gas is evolved when zinc reacts with dilute HCl — this is observed in school labs: bubbles form and the “squeaky pop” test confirms hydrogen. So A is true.
- Reason (R): All metals displace hydrogen from dilute HCl — but copper, silver, and gold don’t react with dilute HCl at all. So R is false.

Correct option: 3) A is correct but R is false

## Build from first principles: what’s really happening?

### Everyday picture first
Think of acid as a crowd of hydrogen ions, H+, waiting to grab electrons. A metal is like a person willing (or unwilling) to donate electrons. If the metal readily gives electrons, H+ accepts them and pairs up into H2 gas — bubbles!

- If the metal is “eager” to lose electrons (more reactive), hydrogen gas forms.
- If the metal is “stingy” (less reactive), nothing happens with a non-oxidising acid like dilute HCl.

### The technical story (redox, step by step)
Two half-reactions explain the fizz:

```math
\text{Oxidation (metal loses electrons):}\quad \text{Zn(s)} \rightarrow \text{Zn}^{2+}\text{(aq)} + 2e^-
```

```math
\text{Reduction (acid gains electrons):}\quad 2\text{H}^+\text{(aq)} + 2e^- \rightarrow \text{H}_2\text{(g)}
```

Add them up:
```math
\text{Zn(s)} + 2\text{H}^+\text{(aq)} \rightarrow \text{Zn}^{2+}\text{(aq)} + \text{H}_2\text{(g)}
```

With chloride ions tagging along:
```math
\text{Zn} + 2\text{HCl} \rightarrow \text{ZnCl}_2 + \text{H}_2\uparrow
```

So A (the assertion) is correct.

### Why R is false: not all metals donate readily
Only metals above hydrogen in the reactivity series can displace H2 from dilute HCl. Examples:
- React: Mg, Al, Zn, Fe, etc. → hydrogen gas forms.
- No reaction with dilute HCl: Cu, Ag, Au (they are less reactive than hydrogen).

Optional deeper check (standard potentials):
- E°(H+/H2) = 0.00 V
- E°(Zn2+/Zn) = −0.76 V → Zn is a strong reducer → reaction with H+ is spontaneous.
- E°(Cu2+/Cu) = +0.34 V → Cu is weaker at giving electrons than H₂ is at taking them → no H2 from dilute HCl.

## Visual aid (described)
Picture zinc atoms on the surface releasing electrons into the solution; nearby H+ ions grab those electrons, two H atoms join to form an H2 molecule, and a bubble lifts off the surface. With copper, the electrons aren’t given up, so no H2 forms.

## Conclusion for the given question

- A is true: Zn + 2HCl → ZnCl2 + H2.
- R is false: Not all metals do this; only those above hydrogen in the reactivity series.
- Answer: 3) A is correct but R is false.

> ### 🧠 Quick Exam Tips
> - Hydrogen from dilute acids forms only with metals above hydrogen in the reactivity series.
> - “Fizzing” = hydrogen gas. Confirm with the squeaky pop test.
> - Copper, silver, gold: no reaction with dilute HCl or dilute H2SO4 (they’re less reactive than hydrogen).
> - Oxidising acids (like nitric acid) can dissolve less reactive metals but usually don’t produce H2 — they produce other gases.

## Conceptual follow-ups
- What if the acid is nitric acid? It’s an oxidising acid; even copper dissolves, but you get NO/NO2, not H2.
- Why does aluminium sometimes seem unreactive? It has a protective oxide layer. Once removed (or in hot acid), it reacts and gives H2.
- Why do some reactions start slow then speed up? Freshly cleaned metal has more active surface; as oxide dissolves, bubbling increases.

---

## Misconception clinic
- “All acids react with all metals to give hydrogen.” Many students think this, but actually dilute non-oxidising acids only produce H2 with metals above hydrogen (e.g., Zn, Fe). Copper won’t.
- “No bubbles means no reaction in any acid.” Not true. Copper reacts with nitric acid but produces NO2, not H2.
- “Reactivity is about strength.” It’s about electron donation tendency (ease of oxidation), not physical strength.

## Mini practice
1) Which metal will NOT produce hydrogen with dilute HCl?
   a) Mg  b) Zn  c) Fe  d) Cu
   Answer: d) Cu

2) Balanced equation for iron with HCl?
   Fe + 2HCl → FeCl2 + H2

3) Predict the effect: If you polish zinc before adding it to HCl, does the rate increase, decrease, or stay the same?
   Increase (more clean surface → faster reaction).
