# Answer

### Start from everyday thinking

Imagine each hydrogen atom as a tiny sphere with one electron. Atoms “like” to be stable, and for tiny atoms like hydrogen, stability means having 2 electrons in the first shell (like helium). A single hydrogen has only 1 electron, so two hydrogens come close and share their electrons. That sharing is a covalent bond.

Textual picture:
- Before bonding: H· + ·H  (each dot is one electron)
- After bonding: H:H or H–H  (shared pair forms a bond)

So one molecule of hydrogen gas is H₂ — made of 2 hydrogen atoms.

```math
\text{H} + \text{H} \longrightarrow \text{H}_2
```

### Analytical view (valency logic)

- Hydrogen’s valency is 1 (it needs 1 more electron to fill its first shell).
- The simplest way for hydrogen to be stable is to pair up and share 1 electron each.
- Therefore, the stable molecule is H₂: two atoms per molecule.

### Experimental clue (how scientists knew)

If 2 volumes of hydrogen react with 1 volume of oxygen to form 2 volumes of steam (at the same temperature and pressure), Avogadro’s idea (equal volumes of gas at the same conditions contain equal numbers of molecules) implies hydrogen and oxygen gases are diatomic (H₂ and O₂). This matches the 2-atom picture.

Answer: 2

> ### 🧠 Quick Exam Tips
> - Hydrogen gas is diatomic: H₂ → 2 atoms per molecule.
> - Other common diatomic elements: N₂, O₂, F₂, Cl₂, Br₂, I₂.
> - Noble gases (He, Ne, Ar, …) are monatomic (single atoms).

### Misconception clinic
- Many students think “a hydrogen molecule has 1 atom because hydrogen’s symbol is H.” But symbols represent elements, not the number of atoms per molecule. The molecule of hydrogen gas is H₂, not H.
- A single hydrogen atom (H) can exist, but as a gas it’s highly reactive; under normal conditions hydrogen prefers the stable H₂ form.

### Quick practice
- How many atoms in a molecule of oxygen gas? Answer: 2 (O₂).
- How many atoms in ozone? Answer: 3 (O₃).
- How many atoms in helium gas? Answer: 1 (He, monatomic).

> ### Reflective essence
> Stability in nature often comes from sharing or pairing to complete “sets.” For atoms, that means filling electron shells; for hydrogen, the simplest stable partnership is a pair—H₂.
