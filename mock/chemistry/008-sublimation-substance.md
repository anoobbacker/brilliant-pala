# Answer

## Which substance shows sublimation?

Start with a picture: Have you seen “mothballs” shrinking without leaving any liquid? Or dry ice “disappearing” into a fog? That solid is skipping the liquid step and turning straight into gas. That’s sublimation.

---

## What is sublimation (in plain words first)?

- Everyday idea: Solid “vanishes” into air without melting.
- Technical phrase: Direct phase change from solid to gas.

Why it happens: At a given pressure (like normal air pressure), some solids have enough energetic surface molecules that they escape directly into the gas phase. If the liquid phase is hard to reach (or not stable at that pressure), the solid just goes to gas.

## How to predict who sublimes: think bonding and structure

- Solid types:
  - Metallic (e.g., Cu): atoms in a sea of electrons; strong bonding.
  - Ionic (e.g., NaCl, CaCO₃): positive and negative ions locked by strong electrostatic forces.
  - Molecular (e.g., I₂): neutral molecules held by weaker attractions (London dispersion forces).

Rule of thumb for exams: Molecular solids with weaker intermolecular forces are most likely to sublime at ordinary conditions. Ionic and metallic solids prefer to melt or decompose rather than sublime.

## Evaluate each option logically

- A) Cu (copper): Metallic solid; strong bonding. On heating, it melts before it would meaningfully turn to gas. Not a typical sublimator.

- B) NaCl (table salt): Ionic lattice; very strong attractions. It has a very high melting point and does not noticeably sublime at ordinary conditions.

- C) I₂ (iodine): Molecular solid; large, squishy electron cloud (high polarizability) gives moderate London forces—stronger than small molecules, but still much weaker than ionic/metallic bonds. Solid iodine has a significant vapor pressure; on gentle heating it forms a beautiful violet vapor that re-deposits as shiny crystals. Classic sublimator.

- D) CaCO₃ (calcium carbonate): When heated, it doesn’t sublime; it decomposes chemically:
  ```math
  \mathrm{CaCO_3(s) \;\to\; CaO(s) + CO_2(g)}
  ```
  That’s thermal decomposition, not sublimation.

Answer: C) I₂

## Why iodine, from a “phase” point of view

Visualize a phase diagram: whether something sublimes, melts, or boils depends on pressure and temperature. Solid iodine has a noticeable vapor pressure below its melting point, so even at 1 atm it can go solid → gas (you see violet vapor), and then gas → solid on a cold surface (deposition). That’s why iodine is used in “sublimation purification” in labs.

---

## Experimental lens

- Setup: Heat iodine crystals gently in a dish with a cold watch glass on top.
- Observation: Purple vapor rises; shiny, black-violet crystals form on the cold surface. That’s sublimation followed by deposition.

---

## Intuitive lens

- If intermolecular bonds are weak (molecular solid), it’s easier for particles to escape the solid straight into gas.
- If bonds are very strong (ionic/metallic), solids either melt first or decompose before they can “skip” to gas.

> - “Famous sublimators”: I₂ (iodine), CO₂(s) (dry ice), naphthalene, camphor, NH₄Cl (but it decomposes to gases that recombine).
> - Ionic solids (NaCl) and metals (Cu) generally do not sublime at ordinary conditions.
> - Decomposition ≠ sublimation: CaCO₃ gives CaO + CO₂ on heating.

## Misconception Clinic

- Many students think “If it forms a gas on heating, it’s sublimation.” Actually, sometimes the solid decomposes into gases (like CaCO₃ or NH₄Cl) rather than going straight solid → gas unchanged.
- A common mistake is assuming “only substances with very low melting points sublime.” Not quite—pressure matters and so does vapor pressure of the solid. Iodine has a moderate melting point but still sublimes noticeably.

---

## Conceptual follow-ups

- What if we lower the air pressure? Sublimation becomes easier because the gas phase is favored at lower pressures; even ice sublimes readily in freeze-drying.
- Why does frost form on cold surfaces? That’s the reverse process: deposition (gas → solid) when water vapor turns straight into ice.

---

## Real-world applications

- Freeze-drying (food, vaccines): Ice in frozen products sublimes under low pressure, removing water without melting, preserving structure and nutrients.
- Purifying solids: Sublimation separates a volatile solid (like iodine) from non-volatile impurities.
