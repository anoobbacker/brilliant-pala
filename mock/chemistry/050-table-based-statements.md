## Big picture: How do we “read” a displacement table from first principles?

Think of metals as people holding onto their electrons like shoppers holding items. Some shoppers grip tightly (less reactive), others let go easily (more reactive). In a solution like CuSO4, the copper is already “let go” as Cu²⁺ ions, floating around, while the sulfate (SO₄²⁻) is just a spectator, like a shopping bag holding the ions together. If a metal strip Y is dipped into CuSO₄:

- If Y is more eager to lose electrons than copper is, then Y will give up electrons to Cu²⁺. The Cu²⁺, receiving electrons, turns back into solid copper metal. Y becomes Y²⁺ and dissolves.
- If Y is less eager to lose electrons than copper, nothing happens—the electrons won’t flow the “wrong way.”

This is the cause-effect rule:
- A more reactive metal displaces a less reactive metal from its compound because the more reactive one is more willing to lose electrons (oxidize).
- The sulfate ion doesn’t decide anything; it’s just balancing charge. The real contest is “metal atom vs. metal ion” over electron transfer.

We can write the electron stories (half-reactions) to make the logic explicit:
```math
\text{Metal } M: \quad M(s) \to M^{2+}(aq) + 2e^- \quad \text{(oxidation: willingness to lose e^-)}
\text{Metal ion } N^{2+}: \quad N^{2+}(aq) + 2e^- \to N(s) \quad \text{(reduction: gaining e^-)}
```
A displacement reaction occurs if the first step is easier for M than for N—i.e., M is more reactive than N.

## What the table tells us, step by step

Given:
- X shows no reaction with ZnSO₄, FeSO₄, CuSO₄.
- Y shows displacement with CuSO₄, but no reaction with ZnSO₄ or FeSO₄.
- Z shows displacement with all three.

Interpretation:
- “No reaction” means the solid metal cannot displace the metal ion from solution → the solid metal is less reactive than the ion’s metal.
- “Displacement reaction” means the solid metal is more reactive than the ion’s metal.

From X:
- X does not react with CuSO₄ → X is less reactive than Cu.
- X does not react with FeSO₄ → X is less reactive than Fe.
- X does not react with ZnSO₄ → X is less reactive than Zn.

From Y:
- Y displaces Cu from CuSO₄ → Y is more reactive than Cu.
- Y does not react with FeSO₄ or ZnSO₄ → Y is less reactive than Fe and Zn.

From Z:
- Z displaces all three → Z is more reactive than Zn, Fe, and Cu.

Therefore, among X, Y, Z, we can order them:
- X is below Cu (very unreactive among these).
- Y sits between Cu and Fe (more than Cu, less than Fe).
- Z sits above Zn (most reactive among these).
So, within X, Y, Z specifically: X < Y < Z.

## Check each statement logically

I) Reaction of Y with CuSO₄ solution produces copper metal.
- True. Because Y displaces Cu²⁺. The net reaction is:
```math
Y(s) + CuSO_4(aq) \to YSO_4(aq) + Cu(s)
```
Half-reactions:
```math
Y(s) \to Y^{2+}(aq) + 2e^- 
Cu^{2+}(aq) + 2e^- \to Cu(s)
```
You would actually see reddish-brown copper deposit on Y, and the blue CuSO₄ solution would lose its blue color as Cu²⁺ is removed.

II) Z is the most reactive and Y the least reactive metal.
- False. Z is the most reactive, yes; but X is the least reactive (cannot displace even copper).

III) Y is more reactive than X and less reactive than Z.
- True. From the order X < Y < Z derived above.

IV) Metal Y produces zinc on reaction with ZnSO₄ solution.
- False. “Produces zinc” would mean Y displaces Zn from ZnSO₄, but the table says “No reaction” for Y with ZnSO₄.

## Final answer
- Correct statements: I and III only
- Option: 3

## Multiple lenses: Why this rule makes sense

- Intuitive: The metal that “lets go” of electrons more easily pushes a less aggressive metal ion out of solution by donating electrons to it.
- Energetic: The process occurs spontaneously when the overall electron flow lowers the system’s energy (like a ball rolling downhill). A more reactive metal has higher “electron pressure,” so electrons flow to reduce the other ion.
- Experimental: Dip a more reactive metal into a less reactive metal’s salt solution and look for signs: color change, metal deposit, gas bubbles (not here), solution conductivity changes.

## Conceptual follow-up questions

1. If a metal W reacts with FeSO₄ but not with ZnSO₄, where does W sit relative to Fe and Zn in reactivity?
2. If X does not react with CuSO₄, can Cu displace X from XSO₄? Predict and explain.
3. If two metals both show “no reaction” with each other’s sulfate solutions, what can you conclude (or not conclude) about their relative reactivity?

## Application questions

1. Why are iron bridges often coated with zinc (galvanization) rather than copper?
2. In batteries, one electrode metal dissolves while the other plates out. How does the displacement logic help you choose electrode pairs to get a spontaneous current?
3. Water pipes can suffer corrosion when joined from different metals. Explain how reactivity differences drive corrosion and how sacrificial anodes prevent it.

## Common misconceptions and reasoning traps

- “The sulfate ion decides the reaction.”  
  Avoid: The metal vs. metal-ion competition decides; sulfate is a spectator for charge balance.
- “No reaction” means never, under any condition.  
  Clarify: It means not spontaneous under given conditions. Heat, catalysts, or different concentrations can change outcomes, but the reactivity order remains a robust guide.
- “More reactive means faster always.”  
  Speed (kinetics) and possibility (thermodynamics) are different. A possible reaction can still be slow if a surface oxide blocks contact.

## Extension challenges

1. Design a simple lab sequence to order four unknown metals using only their sulfate solutions and displacement tests. How do you minimize the number of experiments?
2. Suppose Y forms Y³⁺ instead of Y²⁺ in solution. How might that affect observations, and what extra evidence would you seek to confirm the ion’s charge?
3. Connect to redox potentials: How would you translate the qualitative “more reactive” into quantitative standard electrode potentials E°?

## Reflective insight: The essence

Displacement is electron economics. The metal that values keeping its electrons less will “pay” them to a metal ion that “wants” them more. Observations of who displaces whom let you reconstruct a reactivity ranking without memorization. Once you see reactions as directional electron trades, you can predict outcomes, design protection against corrosion, and even build batteries—by following the logic of electron flow.
