# Question
The amount of glucose required to prepare 250 g of 4.8% solution of glucose by mass

# Answer


## What does “4.8% by mass” really mean?

Imagine making lemonade. If the recipe says “5% sugar by mass,” it means: in every 100 g of lemonade, 5 g is sugar. The rest is water.

So, a 4.8% by mass glucose solution means:
- In every 100 g of the solution, 4.8 g is glucose (the solute), and the rest is solvent (usually water).

## Build the idea from first principles

Percentage by mass is just a ratio scaled to 100.

$$
\text{Mass percent} = \frac{\text{mass of solute}}{\text{mass of solution}} \times 100

$$

We want the mass of glucose (solute) needed to make 250 g of solution at 4.8%.

Rearrange to find solute mass:

$$
\text{mass of solute} 
= \frac{\text{mass percent}}{100} \times \text{mass of solution}
= \frac{4.8}{100} \times 250\ \text{g}
= 0.048 \times 250\ \text{g}
= 12\ \text{g}

$$

So you need 12 g of glucose.

To make the total solution mass 250 g, the rest must be solvent (water):
- Water needed = 250 g − 12 g = 238 g.

## Multiple lenses

- Analytical view:
  $$
  m_{\text{glucose}} = 0.048 \times 250 = 12\ \text{g}
  $$
- Intuitive mental check:
  5% of 250 g is 12.5 g. Since 4.8% is 0.2% less, subtract 0.2% of 250 (which is 0.5 g): 12.5 − 0.5 = 12 g. Makes sense.
- Experimental view:
  On a balance, weigh 12 g glucose and 238 g water, mix until dissolved → total 250 g of 4.8% (m/m) solution.

> ### ✅ Final Answer
> - Glucose required: 12 g
> - Water required (to make 250 g total): 238 g

> ### 🧠 Quick Exam Tips
> - “x% by mass” always means per 100 g of solution, not solvent.
> - Mass percent uses mass of solution in the denominator.
> - Watch units: w/w (mass/mass) is different from w/v (mass per 100 mL).

## Conceptual Follow-ups

- What if the question said 4.8% (w/v) instead? Then 4.8 g per 100 mL of solution. For 250 mL, you’d need 12 g of glucose, but now volume is controlled, not mass.
- If you accidentally add 15 g glucose and still want 4.8% solution, what total mass should the solution be?
  $$
  4.8\% = \frac{15}{M_{\text{solution}}}\times 100 \Rightarrow M_{\text{solution}} = \frac{15 \times 100}{4.8} \approx 312.5\ \text{g}
  $$

## Misconception Clinic

- Many students think the percent is of the solvent. Actually, it’s of the whole solution.
- A common mistake is using 250 g of water instead of 250 g of solution. That would overshoot the concentration.
- Confusing w/w with w/v. Always check the percent’s “type.”

## Extension Challenges

- In biology labs, saline is often 0.9% (w/v). How would your approach change when controlling volume instead of mass?
- In engineering, concentration affects properties like boiling point. How would doubling the percent change boiling point elevation qualitatively?

## Practice Questions

1) How much NaCl is needed to make 500 g of a 6% (w/w) solution?  
2) You have 20 g of sugar. What mass of solution will give a 5% (w/w) concentration?  
3) If 10 g solute is in 200 g solution, what is the mass percent?

Answers:
1) 0.06 × 500 = 30 g  
2) 5% = 20/M × 100 ⇒ M = 400 g  
3) (10/200) × 100 = 5%

> ### 🌱 Reflective Essence
> Percent is just a way to say “part of the whole.” When you control the whole (the solution mass), the part (solute mass) is simply the same fraction of it. Ratio thinking turns messy recipes into clean, predictable math.
