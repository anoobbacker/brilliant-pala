# Answer

### Start with a real-world clue
Have you seen “stage fog” rolling along the floor at concerts? That spooky mist often comes from dry ice. Notice there’s no puddle left behind when it “melts.” That’s the hint: it doesn’t actually melt into a liquid at normal air pressure—so it’s “dry.”

### Intuitive idea first
- Ordinary ice (frozen water) turns into liquid water when warmed.
- Dry ice (frozen carbon dioxide) skips the liquid stage and jumps straight from solid to gas. That jump is called “sublimation.”

Technical term:
- Sublimation = solid → gas without becoming liquid in between.

```math
\text{CO}_2(s) \;\longrightarrow\; \text{CO}_2(g)
```

Why does CO₂ do this at room conditions? Because at normal atmospheric pressure (about 1 atm), CO₂ doesn’t have a stable liquid state. On its phase diagram, the “triple point” (where solid, liquid, and gas can all exist) is at about 5.1 atm. Since everyday air pressure is below that, warming solid CO₂ crosses the sublimation line, not the melting line.

### Quick comparisons to the other options
- A) NH₃ (ammonia): At 1 atm it can be a liquid if it’s cold enough. Not “dry.”
- B) SO₂ (sulfur dioxide): Also has a liquid phase at 1 atm. Not “dry.”
- D) N₂ (nitrogen): At 1 atm, solid nitrogen melts to liquid nitrogen before boiling. Not “dry.”

Only CO₂ at 1 atm cleanly sublimes in everyday conditions, which is why “dry ice” specifically means solid CO₂.

### Experimental view: What would you observe?
- Place dry ice in warm water:
  - Vigorous bubbling (CO₂ gas escaping).
  - A white fog forms above the water. That fog is tiny water droplets from the air, cooled by the very cold CO₂ gas—not “CO₂ smoke.”
- Pass the gas into limewater:
  ```math
  \text{CO}_2(g) + \text{Ca(OH)}_2(aq) \rightarrow \text{CaCO}_3(s) + \text{H}_2\text{O}(l)
  ```
  The limewater turns milky due to calcium carbonate—proof the gas is CO₂.

### Analytical view: Pressure logic (cause → effect)
- Cause: CO₂’s triple point is at ~5.1 atm.
- Effect: At 1 atm (everyday air), there is no “liquid CO₂” path upon warming the solid—only sublimation.
- If you raise pressure above 5.1 atm, then solid CO₂ can melt to liquid CO₂.

### Safety note
- Extremely cold: about −78.5°C. Use gloves/tongs.
- CO₂ gas can displace oxygen. Use in well-ventilated spaces.

> ### 🧠 Quick Exam Tips
> - Dry ice = solid CO₂ (C).
> - “Dry” because it sublimes (no liquid at 1 atm).
> - Fog seen with dry ice is condensed water droplets, not CO₂ itself.
> - CO₂(s) → CO₂(g) at −78.5°C (1 atm).

## Misconception Clinic
- Many students think the white “smoke” from dry ice is CO₂ gas. Actually, CO₂ is invisible; the cloud is tiny water droplets cooled by the gas.
- A common mistake is assuming all solids melt before becoming gas. Not always—some substances (like CO₂, iodine, naphthalene) can sublime at accessible conditions.
- Some think “dry ice” could be any solid gas. In practice, the term refers specifically to solid CO₂.

---

## What-if and extensions
- What if we increase the pressure above ~5.1 atm? Then CO₂ can exist as a liquid, so solid CO₂ could melt before boiling.
- Why does dry ice sit low to the ground? CO₂ gas is denser than air, so it pools in low areas.
