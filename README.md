# Screening Test Information

## 🧮 Test Structure

| Subject | Section A | Section B |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Physics /Chemistry /Mathematics /Biology | 15 nos | 10 nos |
| ✅ Correct Answer | 4 marks | 4 marks |
| ❌ Negative Mark | -1 mark | 0 |

## ⚡Marking Scheme
### Section A (MCQ):
  * 15 Questions per subject
  * 4 options each (1–4)

### Section B (Numerical):
  * 10 Questions per subject
  * Student can attempt **any 5**
  * If more than 5 answered, only the **first 5** will be evaluated
  * Each question’s answer is a number (1–3 digits)

- More than one answer marked against a question will be deemed as incorrect answer.
-  No negative mark for unattended questions
- **Total Questions**: 75
- **Maximum Marks**: 240 (4 x 45 + 4x15)

## 🧭 Clear Picture of the Paper

| Section | Type              | Questions         | Marking | Notes                               |
| ------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **A**   | MCQ (one correct) | 15                | +4, –1  | Needs accuracy, avoid guessing      |
| **B**   | Numerical (0–999) | 10, attempt any 5 | +4, 0   | No negative marking — attempt all 5 |

## 🕒 Time Division (for 120 minutes)

| Subject             | Recommended Time | Focus                                         |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Biology**         | 45 min           | Fastest scoring — recall-based, attempt first |
| **Chemistry**       | 35 min           | Concept + formula mix, moderate speed         |
| **Physics / Maths**         | 35 min           | Calculation-heavy — keep for last             |
| **Buffer / Review** | 5 min            | For checking marked questions                 |

💡 *Rule of thumb:* Never spend more than **2 min** on a single question.
If it takes longer, mark and skip — come back later.

## 🧠 Attempt Order (to build confidence)

1. **Start with Biology (Section A first)** — many direct memory-based Qs, quick wins build momentum.
2. Then **Chemistry** — Organic & Inorganic are quick, leave long Numericals for later.
3. **Physics / Maths last** — fresh mind helps calculations, but by now timer discipline is built.

Within each subject:

* Do **Section A (MCQ)** first — needs focus and accuracy.
* Then move to **Section B (Numerical)** — no negative marking, attempt all 5.

## 🎯 Scoring Mindset

| Question Type          | Attempt If          | Why                    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| MCQ (–1 negative)      | ≥70 % sure          | Else skip              |
| Numerical (0 negative) | Even if partly sure | Logical estimate helps |

🧩 **Tip:** Don’t leave numerical blanks — write something logical, since no penalty.

## 📊 Ideal Marks Target

| Subject   | Reasonable Target (out of 80)                        |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Biology   | 60–64 (≈15 right)                                    |
| Chemistry | 52–60 (≈13–14 right)                                 |
| Physics   | 44–52 (≈11–13 right)                                 |
| **Total** | **≈170–180 / 240** — Excellent score for AIIMS track |

## 🔁 3-Round Plan

| Round           | Duration                              | Purpose                                            |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Round 1**     | 55 min                                | Solve only sure-shot questions (confidence ≥ 80 %) |
| **Round 2**     | 40 min                                | Return to “Mark for Review” ones                   |
| **Round 3**     | 20 min                                | Attempt all numerical + educated guesses           |
| **Final 5 min** | Review submissions, check unmarked Qs |                                                    |

## ⚙️ Technical Discipline
* Avoid random guessing in MCQs.
* Keep paper sheet for quick rough work, label each subject clearly.
* Watch the countdown timer every 15–20 minutes.

---

## 💬 Psychological Prep

* Start calmly; take 3 deep breaths before the first click.
* If one subject feels tough, remind them *others may also find it tough — focus on accuracy*.
* Encourage confidence: *“I don’t need all right, I just need the next one right.”*
